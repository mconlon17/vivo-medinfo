<research>

I have diverse research interests that reflect my areas of clinical responsibility. As the division director of Genitourinary pathology my interests are principally in translational research in the prostate, bladder and kidneys and providing support to basic science research within the department of Urology, one of the leading academic Urology departments in the Southeastern U.S. My particular interest is in the evaluation of novel immunohistochemical markers for germ cell neoplasia.


As an attending hematopathologist, I am interested in developing new diagnostic techniques for flow cytometry and in utilizing flow cytometry to aid in the diagnosis of hematolymphoid neoplasia. In addition, I collaborate with the department of Physiology and Functional Genomics on studies involving JAK2 kinase mutations and small molecule inhibitors.


As Laboratory Medical Director of UF Pathology Laboratories, an independent reference laboratory in the department of pathology, I also am engaged in molecular pathology and pharmacogenomics.

<biography>

Tetsuo Ashizawa, MD, graduated from Keio University School of Medicine in Tokyo, Japan, in 1973. He completed his neurology residency training at Baylor College of Medicine, where he climbed academic ranks to tenured full professor in 1997. In 2002, he was recruited to The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston to chair the department of neurology. In 2009 he moved to the University of Florida, where he is executive director of the Evelyn F. and William L. McKnight Brain Institute of UF and chair of the department of neurology.


Dr. Ashizawa is an expert on inherited neurological disorders caused by repeated expansion mutations, including myotonic dystrophy type 1 and 2. He was a member of a team that discovered the myotonic dystrophy type 1 gene in 1992. He is a founder of the International Myotonic Dystrophy Consortium, the most prestigious and comprehensive clinical and scientific consortium of DM1 and DM2. He has served on the Scientific Advisory Committee of the National Registry of Myotonic Dystrophy and Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy and is serving on the Scientific Advisory Board of the Myotonic Dystrophy Foundation. He received the Hans Steinert Award in 2009, commemorating the 100th birthday of Hans Steinert who first described myotonic dystrophy. Dr. Ashizawa is a clinician-scientist and has seen a large number of DM1 and DM2 patients. Recently, he started a project of DM1 patient-derived, induced pluripotent stem cells. He participated in a study to search RNA splicing biomarkers in muscle samples from DM1 patients, sponsored by the Marigold Foundation, and is now on the team to test the efficacy of antisense oligonucleotide therapy in DM1.

Dr. Adam Beck is an Assistant Professor of Surgery in the Division of Vascular Surgery and Endovascular Therapy at the University of Florida College of Medicine.


He earned his medical degree from the University of Alabama School of Medicine, and then completed his general surgery residency training and a surgical oncology research fellowship at the University of Texas-Southwestern Medical Center. He trained in Vascular Surgery at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center and then completed a fellowship in advanced endovascular techniques, including branched and fenestrated endografts for aortic aneurysmal disease, at the University Medical Center of Groningen in The Netherlands.


His clincial interests span the field of Vascular Surgery, including open surgery and endovascular therapy for aortic, cerebrovascular, mesenteric and peripheral artery disease, with a specific interest in complex aortic disease, including aortic dissection, suprarenal and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms.


He is focused on new advances in fenestrated and branched endografts for thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms and is involved in clincial trials for new devices.


His research focuses on biomarkers of spinal cord ischemia after aortic surgery, as well as new techniques for minimally invasive aortic repair. He is also interested in quality improvement measures and in 2011 established the Florida Vascular Study Group, which has subsequently become the Florida-Georgia Vascular Study Group (FGVSG). The FGVSG fosters regional collaboration among physicians and hospitals to collect and analyze data from vascular patients to set quality benchmarks and improve care.

Dr. Brakenridge works with the multi-disciplinary research team investigating the persistent inflammation/immunosuppression and catabolism syndrome (PICS)that occurs after surgical sepsis. His current research projects include:


<em>
Persistent inflammation/immunosuppresion and catabolism syndrome (PICS)
</em>
: Advances in critical care medicine over the past two decades have significantly decreased in-hospital mortality following sepsis in surgical and trauma patients. However, instead of dying from septic shock and sudden multiple organ failure, patients survive with an extended course of chronic critical illness. When we studied the epidemiology of these patients, we recognized that many of the survivors lingered in the intensive care unit with manageable organ dysfunctions. Their clinical course is characterized by recurrent inflammatory insults (e.g., repeat operations and nosocomial infections, which are those that originate in a hospital), a persistent acute-phase response with ongoing loss of lean body mass despite optimal nutritional support, poor wound healing and bedsores.


These patients (especially the elderly) are commonly discharged to long-term acute care facilities and skilled nursing facilities with significant cognitive and functional impairments, from which they rarely recover fully. Few ever return to independent function and more than 60 percent of these patients are dead within two years. The researchers in the laboratory of inflammation biology and surgical science at UF Health hypothesize that chronic critical illness, driven by PICS and characterized by morbid long-term outcomes, is now the predominant clinical trajectory in surgical ICU sepsis survivors.


<em>Venous thromboembolism after traumatic injury:</em>
Despite the widespread, aggressive use of preventative protocols, venous thromboembolism (deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) continues to be a significant source of morbidity and mortality after severe traumatic injury. Dr. Brakenridge and his colleagues have found that pulmonary emboli occur very early after injury, calling into question the traditional dogma of injury, prolonged immobilization and venous stasis leading to venous thrombosis and subsequent embolus to the blood vessels in the lungs. Currently, we are investigating these early post-injury thrombotic events to determine both their significance and cause.

<biography>

Dr. Brown is an Associate Professor here at the UF College of Medicine's Department of Psychiatry, the Addiction Medicine Group, the Florida Recovery Center, and UF's Pain Evaluation and Treatment Program.


After graduation from Clemson University, Dr. Brown matriculated to MUSC where she was a medical student, intern, resident, Chief Resident and finally an Addiction Psychiatry Fellow. After graduation, she moved to New Orleans where she was an Assistant Professor at the LSU Medical School and became Louisiana State Physician Health Program Director. This program is quite similar to PRN in Florida. During this time she began evaluating and treating professional athletes. Before long, she became the psychiatrist for the New Orleans Saints. After years of working with professional athletes, she began evaluating other athletes from around the United States. After leading this state of Louisiana evaluation and recovery program for impaired health professionals, developing prevention and treatment for patients from physicians to professional athletes, she was recruited to the University of South Florida (USF) Medical School. At USF she became an Associate Professor of Psychiatry and Director of the Division of Addiction Psychiatry. In 2006, in addition to this position, she became Associate Dean for Faculty Development in the USF College of Medicine. According to Dr. Brown: "Yes, I loved Tampa but UF COM has the largest and one of the very best addiction research and treatment programs in the United States! I couldn't wait to move and start working with the UF faculty and FRC staff. "

<research>

Dr. Bubb's laboratory studies the regulation of actin polymerization in cell motility. We investigate the cell biology and biochemistry of actin-binding proteins specifically as they pertain to such topics as apoptosis, angiogenesis, immunology and cancer biology. We also study pharmacologic agents that affect actin polymerization. We use a variety of biophysical techniques to answer specific questions regarding mechanisms controlling cell motility, including time-dependent fluorescence spectroscopy and analytical ultracentrifugation.


Specific ongoing projects include (1) a study of the MARCKS protein as it relates to neurodevelopment, synaptic plasticity and memory, (2) a study of the structure and immunomodulatory properties of thymosin 4, and (3) the development of cancer chemotherapeutic agents that target the actin cytoskeleton, and (4) a study of predicted outcomes and response to therapy in rheumatoid arthritis based on the role of TNF-alpha in cytoskeletal dynamics.

<biography>

Dr. Bucciarelli a graduate of the University of Michigan School of Medicine ('72M), is boarded in Pediatrics, Pediatric Cardiology, and Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine and continues to actively practice Neonatology at the University of Florida.


After graduation and completion of his pediatric training at the University of Florida, he served as a member of the pediatric faculty at the University of Utah for four years. He then returned to the University of Florida in 1982 as Chief of Neonatology.


In 1990 Dr. Bucciarelli became a Robert Wood Johnson Health Policy Fellow and worked in the office of Senator John D. Rockefeller IV (D-WV). As a health policy legislative assistant, Rick was instrumental in drafting several pieces of legislation, including the Medicare physician payment system (RBRVS) and the Democratic leadership bill for universal health coverage for all Americans. From 1991-2001, Rick served as Associate Chair of Pediatrics and became very involved in pediatric health policy research as a member of the Institute for Child Health Policy at UF. For the past several years, Rick and his colleagues have analyzed various aspects of the Healthy Kids program in Florida, as well as, Florida's SCHIP program, KidCare.


He has served on the AAP Committee on Federal Governmental Affairs for six years before becoming Chair in 1999. At the same time he was appointed as Chair of the AAP Workgroup on Access and Health Care Coverage for Children and is one of the major architects of the AAP MediKids proposal, which was introduced by Representative Pete Stark (D-CA) and Senator John D. Rockefeller, IV (D-WV) in the spring of 2001 and reintroduced in the 107th Congress on March 11, 2003. He currently serves on the Academy's Committee on State Governmental Affairs.


In January of 2001, he became the Associate Vice-President for Health Affairs for Governmental Relations, representing the health science department in Washington and in Tallahassee and in September of 2002, he was appointed Vice President for Government Relations for the University of Florida where he was responsible for all government relations activities for the University at both the state and federal levels. In April 2004, he returned to the UF Health Science Center in his capacity as Associate Vice President for Health for Government Relations. In May 2007 he assumed the duties of Interim Chair of the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Florida and was appointed Chair and Nemours Eminent Scholar in March 2008. With this appointment, Rick resigned his government relations position to dedicate full time to the department and to advocacy for children's health care issues. Dr. Bucciarelli held the chair position until 2012.


He remains active as a practicing neonatologist and teacher and is the Immediate Past-President of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.


Rick and Lynda are avid Gators. They have two children: Amy, an art therapist at UF Health and Chris, a resident in pediatrics at the University of Florida.

Dr. Bussing's major clinical interests include comprehensive treatment approaches to disruptive disorders of childhood, combining pharmacotherapy, parent training, clinical group therapies, and school interventions. Dr. Bussing enjoys treating the entire spectrum of child and adolescent disorders. Of special clinical interest is the comprehensive outpatient treatment of disruptive disorders of childhood, combining evidence-based pharmacological and psychosocial therapies. She adapted an established parent group intervention for ADHD, combining it with a child social skills group, into an 8-week manual-based program. Another related project has been the development of a school problem clinic in conjunction with our psychology services. This clinic provides multidisciplinary assessment of the various school problem children get referred for, with comprehensive treatment planning including medication regimens, behavioral interventions, and tutoring.

<biography>

My laboratory is focused on understanding the pathophysiology of inherited cardioskeletal myopathies and therapeutic strategies using gene therapy. Specifically, we have developed novel gene therapies for neuromuscular diseases such as Pompe disease. The disease is characteristic of many muscle diseases which lead to skeletal and cardiac muscle weakness. We have used AAV vectors to achieve sustained correction of the gene deficiency in Pompe disease models leading to restoration of contractile and metabolic function of striated muscle and motor nerves. Recently, we have incorporated novel combinations of AAV serotypes and/or capsid modifications with tissue-specific promoters to direct gene transduction and expression of the therapeutic transgene. Our approach (AAV) is now being evaluated in a human clinical trial investigating the safety and efficacy of direct gene delivery to the diaphragm.

<biography>

After obtaining his MD and MSc in clinical investigation, Dr. Cheng was trained in molecular biology and genetics while being a W.H.O fellow at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London. Subsequently, he applied this knowledge and skills to his Ph.D study at Karolinska Institue, and characterized hormonal regulation of this ion pump by second messenger-mediated phosphorylation signaling. As a postdoctoral fellow at Vanderbilt and Yale, he expanded his training in ion transport physiology to include FEN (fluid/electrolyte/nutrition) and CaSR (calcium-sensing receptor) physiology and pathology, in relation to the GI diseases in children. This work resulted in publications in AJP, Gastroenterology and PNAS. It also laid the groundwork for his proposed research herein. The current work builds logically on his prior work and previous training in combination with his current interests as a GI physiologist and pediatric gastroenterologist. He is especially interested in IBD (inflammatory bowel disease), IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) and other diarrheal disorders in children.

<biography>

Dr. Christman joined the faculty in 2013 to direct the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at the University of Florida. He has a long-standing clinical research interest in the biology underlying the pathogenesis of uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) and for 2012-2013 he was chosen to chair the Fibroid Special Interest Group of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine. Dr. Christman is a Professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and is board certified in both Obstetrics and Gynecology and the subspecialty of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. His clinical interests include the care of women with polycystic ovarian disease, premature ovarian failure, endometriosis, leiomyomas, and infertility. His basic research interests include the study of apoptosis, gene therapy, and the development of prevention strategies to block the formation of uterine leiomyomas. He is currently involved in several clinical research studies in infertility management regarding the optimal use for medications used for ovulation induction, the use of GnRH analogs to prevent ovarian toxicity in women receiving alkylating chemotherapy, and the development and clinical application of novel non-hormonal treatments for endometriosis.


Dr. Christman completed both his medical school (1983) and OB/GYN residency training at the University of Wisconsin (1987). At the completion of his residency training, Dr. Christman completed a 3-year T32 NSRA NIH Clinical Research Training Fellowship in Endocrinology and Metabolism at the University of Michigan Reproductive Sciences Program in 1990. During this time he initiated and completed an NIH clinical study regarding the effectiveness of estradiol and progesterone in slowing rapid GnRH pulsatility in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome. This study led to the landmark discovery that women with Polycystic Ovarian Disease (PCOS) had an intrinsic inability to slow down hypothalamic GnRH pulse frequency when presented physiologic luteal levels of steroids. After his research fellowship, Dr. Christman was a Clinical Fellow in Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. Following this Dr. Christman joined the faculty at the University of Michigan in 1992 where he received the Berlex Scholar Award for Basic Science Research in 1993 to continue the research initiated during his fellowship at the University of North Carolina where he had been awarded the ACOG/Mead Johnson Clinical Research Fellowship Award in 1991. During this initial period at the University of Michigan, he established his interest in the study of uterine leiomyomas and was continuously funded by the NIH in this area for over 9 years. From 2006-2007 he completed additional postdoctoral training during his sabbatical in the laboratory of Dr. Jim Segars at the NIH in Bethesda, MD, where the phenomenon of mechano-transduction was identified as a new target for future fibroid therapies. In addition to his research on leiomyomas, Dr. Christman played a key role in several multicenter clinical research projects. In 1998, he served as a co-investigator on a NIH multicenter project looking at the safety of oral contraceptives in women with systemic lupus erythematous (OC-SELENA Trial) and he was a co-investigator on a multicenter case-control clinical trial performed at Michigan, Harvard and the University of South Carolina looking at the ability of GnRH agonists to protect the ovary from the toxic effects of alkylating chemotherapy. Results from the multicenter OC-SELENA Trial demonstrated that a population of women with SLE could be defined where oral contraceptives could be given safely. The results of the GnRH agonist trial demonstrated that treatment with GnRH agonist during cyclophosphamide therapy was associated with a significant reduction of subsequent premature ovarian failure.


Dr. Christman was one of seven principal investigators involved in the last cycle of the NICHD Reproductive Medicine Network participating in the recently completed AMIGOS and PPCOS II Trials. At the University of Florida, Dr. Christman continues his work on an NICHD RO1 grant focusing on the use of GnRH analogs to prevent the ovarian toxicity of alkylating chemotherapy in women receiving immunosuppression for acute disease flares related to several rheumatologic conditions (PROTECT Trial).

<biography>

Michael J. Clare-Salzler,MD, received his medical degree and internal medicine training from the State University of New York at Buffalo. He began his clinical endocrinology and immunology research career at the University of California in Los Angeles, where he studied the immunopathogenesis of type 1 diabetes.


Since coming to the University of Florida department of pathology, immunology and laboratory medicine in 1993, he has been pursuing basic and clinical research in type 1 diabetes pathogenesis. His major research focus is on the role of antigen-presenting cells in the immunopathogenesis of this disease and how these cells guide the development of either T-cell tolerance or immunity. He is the author of more than 100 publications, and the National Institutes of Health and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation fund his research. He serves on several NIH committees and national advisory boards. He also holds several patents derived from his research work.


Dr. Clare-Salzler maintains an active practice in endocrinology, treating patients with diabetes and other endocrine diseases.

Diagnosis and Treatment of Thoracic Malignancies

Geriatric Oncology


The primary focus of Dr. Close's clinical efforts including clinical investigations is the patient with thoracic malignancies including patients with upper aero digestive and lung cancers. Thoracic malignancies represent one of the largest groups of patients with cancer seen at the University of Florida and the VA hospital. The care of these patients and the exploration of novel management strategies involve a multi-disciplinary team of medical, radiation and surgical oncologists. In partnership with the palliative care team at the VA and with appropriate individuals at the University of Florida, Dr. Close is also the primary provider for diverse and burgeoning population of geriatric patients with a host of malignancies.

<biography>

Dr. Cogle is a physician-scientist with clinical and research expertise in the myelodysplastic syndromes, acute leukemias, and bone marrow failure syndromes. He uses blood and marrow transplantation as a treatment option for patients who need more than chemotherapy to eradicate disease. Dr. Cogle also runs a stem cell research laboratory where he dissects the mechanisms of bone marrow-derived blood vessels. His research has made significant impact in the fields of cancer and cardiology. Dr. Cogle's overall goal is to design safer and more effective methods of treating diseases by tapping into the potential of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.

Dr. Cogle's research focus is on human hematopoietic stem cells and cancer initiating cells. Specifically, his laboratory is focused on the following projects:



<em>
Defining the Hemangioblast Activity of the Human Hematopoietic Stem Cell (HSC)
</em>


This project aims to define the ability of the human hematopoietic stem cell in repairing injured blood vessels. To test this hypothesis we track blood vessel repair in immunocompromised mice transplanted with human HSC enriched from umbilical cord blood, bone marrow and mobilized peripheral blood. Additionally, we study new blood vessel growth in patients and try to determine to what extent the bone marrow is the origin.



<em>
Defining the Pathologic Hemangioblast Activity of the Hematopoietic Stem Cell in Cancer Blood Vessel Development
</em>


This project seeks to define the ability of the hematopoietic stem cell and bone marrow in contributing to the pathologic growth of blood vessels within cancer. To test this hypothesis we analyze blood vessels growing within cancers asking to what extent they are of bone marrow origin. We have developed anti-cancer treatments based on this research.



<em>
Bone Marrow Cell Injections for Heart Disease

</em>

This project tests the ability of bone marrow cells to repair hearts after heart attacks. The Cogle laboratory is a core laboratory for the NIH Cardiovascular Cell Therapy Research Network, testing the functional capacity of bone marrow and blood in patients who receive bone marrow injections in their hearts. In addition, new technologies are being developed to enhance the function of bone marrow cells to repair the injured hearts better.


<em>

Defining the Hemangioblast Activity of Leukemia Stem Cells


</em>
This project aims to define how leukemias exhibit hemangioblast activity, producing not only malignant leukemic cells but also malignant endothelial cells. The significance of this project is that if leukemia demonstrates hemangioblast activity, the generated malignant endothelia may serve as a sanctuary for later relapse. This begs for an alternative approach to leukemia treatment.



Dr. Cogle's clinical work focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of patients with the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), acute leukemias and bone marrow failure syndromes. His clinical research has resulted in discovery of new biomarkers which identify patients who would best respond to specific treatments. In addition, he and his colleagues conduct clinical trials testing novel hypomethylating agents and antivascular therapies for patients with MDS and acute leukemias. Dr. Cogle also performs blood and marrow transplantation for patients with MDS, acute leukemias and bone marrow failure. He and his colleagues have developed new transplant regimens including purging techniques, haplotransplantation and mesenchymal stem cell infusion protocols. The overall objective of Dr. Cogle's clinical and clinical research efforts is to better diagnosis and eradicate blood cancers.

<biography>

Maria Constantinidou, Psy.D., graduated from Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, Florida before receiving her doctorate in clinical psychology from Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. She completed a pre-doctoral internship at Rockland Psychiatric Hospital in New York and two years of a post-doctoral residency with the University of Florida's division of medical psychology, in the Behavioral Health Unit, specializing in anxiety disorders with an emphasis on Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and with UF's Eating Disorders Recovery Center. During her second year of post-doctoral residency, Constantinidou was recruited and assisted in the founding of the Eating Disorders Recovery Program. She helped write the treatment manual and provided training workshops and presentations for clinical and nursing staff. She also assisted in the hiring process of the EDRC staff, while training the other therapists in treating complicated eating disorders. In December of 2012, Constantinidou became a faculty member of the department of psychiatry. She currently treats patients with both eating disorders and anxiety disorders at Shands Vista and the Springhill outpatient clinic. In addition, she supervises residents and practicum students, while she is actively involved in the development of an academic curriculum that would open the opportunity to medical students and undergraduate students to learn more about eating disorders, and have shadowing opportunities. Constantinidou' s eclectic treatment approach assists patients to find their inner tools to help them overcome their fears, anxieties, and find a meaning and purpose in their lives. Constantinidou' s direct, honest and empathic approach, while utilizing Exposure Response Prevention, Dialectical Behavior Therapy, ACT and a patient-center approach allows the patients to open up and explore issues in their lives which prevent them from functioning at their best capacity. Similarly, understanding that an unhealthy eating pattern is not the primary issue of patients, who suffer from an eating disorder, Constantinidou explores the underlying distresses of this disorder. The teachings of various techniques such as mindfulness, radical acceptance and distress tolerance, the patients are given an opportunity to experience their life fully.

<biography>

Born in Connecticut, Wayne Creelman, M.D. received his undergraduate degree in biology, philosophy and theology from Boston College. Dr. Creelman graduated Magna Cum Laude from Boston College. Dr. Creelman has had a lifelong interest in biology, religion and philosophy. Teaching at Boston College High School for a year, he then attended Georgetown University School of Medicine. Finishing an internship at Hartford Hospital (Connecticut) he went on to complete Psychiatric Residency at The Institute of Living where he founded the Psychopharmacology Consultation Service and served as an assistant service chief. While a resident at the Institute, Dr. Creelman also worked at Yale University and with David Gross, M.D. From 1982 until 1986 Dr. Creelman was an Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine and Teaching Faculty and Residency Training Program mentor and module Director in Psychopharmacology at the Institute of Living. After this, he assumed a position as a Clinical Assistant and then Clinical Associate Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Vermont College of Medicine (1986-1994). He then matriculated to Tulane University to finish his degree in Health Management in the Tulane School of Public Health. He directed for eight years Psychopharmacology at the Maine Medical Center. At Maine he was Chief of Psychopharmacology, director of psychiatric research and an administrator of both the inpatient and outpatient divisions. In addition to Clinical and Administrative work in Psychiatry, Dr. Creelman also successfully conducted several phase three drug trials in psychopharmacology.


He was then recruited to Buffalo, New York where he held the progressive positions of Corporate Medical Director/COO of the BryLin Hospitals, Chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at the Millard Fillmore Health System and President/Corporate Medical Director of the Western New York Behavioral Medicine and Psychotherapies, PLLC. An Associate Clinical Professorship at the State University of New York allowed for resident supervision and psychopharmacology teaching. In addition to his leadership in the Department of Psychiatry and the Medical Center, Dr Creelman built a successful psychiatry and addictions program at BryLin with 10 full-time and 30 part and ndash; time physicians in his Department. He led JCAHO survey preparation and oversaw all clinical, administrative, managerial, research and educational activities. He also mentored medical directors and psychiatric residents and other health professionals.


Prior to joining the University of Florida faculty in September of 2006, Dr. Creelman was a Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at the Michigan State University College of Human Medicine, Psychiatry Clerkship Director at the Grand Rapids Campus, Behavioral Medical Director for Care Choices HMO of Michigan and EVP/Chief Medical Officer at the Pine Rest Christian Mental Health Services. Again, in keeping with his interest in both medicine/biology and religion/philosophy he was named Chief Integrity Officer.


As an a Professor in the Department of Psychiatry Dr. Creelman splits his time between supervising residents and teaching psychopharmacology in the UF Outpatient Psychiatry Clinic at Shands Medical Plaza and serving as the Medical Executive Director at the Northeast Florida State Hospital in MacClenny overseeing the clinical operations of a 600+ bed state psychiatric facility with the executive oversight of 196 full time clinical/administrative employees. This is a very important State of Florida position which Dr. Creelman has expanded in scope from clinical care to improve training of University of Florida College of Medicine, medical students, University of Florida Psychiatry Residents, and University of Florida Forensic Fellows. As a result of his efforts in integrating his role as Medical Executive Director at MacClenny with those of the University of Florida College of Medicine, he was appointed Professor and Chief of the Division of Community Psychiatry. He has also been a University of Florida Shands Teaching Hospital attending in Gainesville where he sees private patients and is the attending of a very popular Psychiatry Resident teaching clinic.

<biography>

As a urologic oncologist I specialize in the surgical treatment of cancers involving the kidney, bladder, prostate, testis, and penis. My training as a Urologic Oncologist began at Temple University School Medicine where I received my medical degree and completed a Urology residency. During my residency I had the opportunity to study at the Fox Chase Cancer Center where I was first introduced to the importance of comprehensive cancer care and clinical research. Following completion of residency I received fellowship training in Urologic Oncology at the Mayo Clinic. I then joined the faculty at the University of Kentucky where I remained for 3 years with a focus on multidisciplinary cancer care at the Markey Cancer Center.


Through my training and clinical experience I have learned the importance of patient education prior to making treatment decisions. By empowering patients with knowledge of their cancer we can create a relationship in which a patients have a more active role in the decision making process. Furthermore, I know that every patient has unique set of needs and goals and that their treatment plan must be tailored to meet their individual needs and goals. For these reasons we offer patients a broad range of treatment options ranging from watchful waiting and single modality therapy to multimodal treatment which may involve several types therapy including surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. In regard to the surgical treatment of genitourinary malignancies I have experience in both minimally invasive and traditional surgical techniques which allows me to offer patients the approach which is best suited for their individual needs. Regardless of which type of treatment a patient pursues we place emphasis on minimizing any potential treatment related morbidity.


My research interest is primarily related to improving the evaluation and treatment of patients presenting with genitourinary malignancies. To date, most of my research effort has focused on the management of kidney cancer, evaluating the natural history of the malignancy and methods to improve treatment selection. Additionally, I have a strong interest in involving appropriately selected patients in clinical trials which are designed to evaluate new treatment regimens and hopefully improve the care of patients at the University of Florida and beyond.

Dr. L. Dang's research interests are in the translational and clinical development of combination therapy targeting the tumor vasculature and cancer cell survival mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment. Using gene knockout models, he has found that targeted disruption of both the VEGF pathway and the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIF-1 and HIF-2) survival pathway to be synergistic. He has also found novel HIF targets which may be tested as predictive biomarkers and as targets for therapy. To translate these concepts, he is working with the drug discovery team to develop novel compounds using both high throughput and
<em>in silico</em>
drug screens.

<research>

Research skills and a good bedside manner can coexist. The overarching goal of Dan Driscoll's research is to blend meaningful discoveries at the laboratory bench and the patient's bedside which ultimately will result in significant treatments for both children and adults. His research interests are focused in three interrelated areas that combine his clinical and basic science expertise; Genomic imprinting/Epigenetics; Prader-Willi syndrome; and Early-onset morbid obesity.


Driscoll, a professor of pediatrics and genetics and the John T. and Winifred M. Hayward Professor of Genetics Research studies Prader-Willi syndrome as a model system to understand genomic imprinting and early-onset morbid obesity. Genomic imprinting is a recently discovered phenomenon whereby certain genes are expressed differently depending upon whether they are inherited from the mother or the father.


"A disturbance in genomic imprinting in humans has been shown to play a major role in a number of birth defects, genetic diseases and cancers," says Driscoll.


Driscoll's laboratory developed a system over a decade ago which is now used worldwide as a rapid means to make the diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome as well as several other imprinted disorders. This methodology, in many cases, has allowed the diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome to be made at a much earlier age which has resulted in earlier treatment and better outcomes for this condition.


In addition, his laboratory was the first to propose and demonstrate a whole new class of mutations which are now called imprinting defects. This type of mutation has since been found in several other diseases and cancers.


Most recently, Driscoll and his colleagues have shown that early-onset childhood obesity is associated with cognitive impairment and white matter lesions in the brain. They postulate that the metabolic disturbances of early obesity could be having deleterious effects on the young, vulnerable brain.


"It's well-known that obesity is associated with a number of other medical problems, such as diabetes, hypertension and elevated cholesterol," says Driscoll, the lead author of the study. "Now, we're postulating that early-onset morbid obesity and the subsequent metabolic/ biochemical problems can also lead to cognitive impairment."

Sickle cell disease (SCD) and hemophilia and some other blood disorders are severe, lifelong and presently incurable diseases. We are instituting new programs to study and better treat iron overload in multiply transfused patients, comprehensive management of cardiac and pulmonary disease in SCD and other initiatives to improve the transiton of care from adolescence to adulthood and overall quality of life of these patients. University of Florida is at the forefront of research in AAV (adeno-associated virus) vectors for gene therapy that aims to cure SCD and hemophilia while promising to cure other similar illnesses caused by single gene defects.

<biography>

Dr. Raman S. Dusaj is an Assistant Professor, specializing in general cardiology, in UF's Division of Cardiovascular Medicine. His clinical interests include CT coronary angiography, pulmonary hypertension, and normal LV systolic function heart failure (a current IRB approved study that looks for echo determinants for the development of heart failure, despite normal LV systolic function, in a cohort of patients with LVH and hypertension asked to increase afterload with hand grip). Another clinical interest is apical thinning (an IRB submitted study looking for the relationship between apical thinning on nuclear imaging and demonstration of scar by delayed gadolinium enhancement on MRI). Dr. Dusaj received his BS from the University of Maryland in biochemistry and molecular biology. In 2005, he received his MD from SUNY Upstate Medical University. While studying at George Washington University, Dr. Dusaj completed his internship in internal medicine in 2008 and postgraduate education in cardiology in 2011. He was award the ACC
<em>Young Investigator</em>
Award in 2009 and the Annual Society of Cardiovascular CT's
<em>Toshiba Young Investigator</em>
Award in 2010.

<biography>

Dr. Efron is an assistant professor of surgery in the University Florida's College of Medicine. In 2009, he became the associate medical director of the trauma ICU. In addition, Dr. Efron established a Surgical Critical Care Fellowship Program at UF in 2010, which he currently directs. He is an Advanced Trauma Life Support instructor and has been selected for committees and leadership positions in several medical societies, including the Shock Society, the Surgical Infection Society and the Society of Critical Care Medicine. He also is a member of the Association for Academic Surgery and the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma and has applied for fellowship in the American College of Surgeons.


He co-directs the Laboratory of Inflammation Biology and Surgical Science and focuses his research on inflammation and immunology in severe injury and infection. Dr. Efron has created novel methodologies for studying trauma and further developed the laboratory's sepsis research to include well- known factors associated with mortality, including blood product transfusion and aging. In addition, he has led the translational human studies in trauma and sepsis at UF's surgical intensive care unit.


Dr. Efron joined UF's acute care surgery section at the end of 2008.

<research>

In epilepsy, Dr. Eisenschenk's main interests are in the cellular and biochemical basis of seizures and sleep-related disorders. His primary research interests at present include the development of methods to analyze multi-spectral data, specifically DTI, T1 and T2 MRI brain scans, to assess the morphological anatomical changes in the brain concurrently with identification of neuronal networks (tractography) connecting various regions of the brain that can be correlated with functional measures in patients with seizures. In addition, he also is pioneering the assessment of driving performance during seizures, objective measures to assess driving capacity in epileptics, and the effects of antiepileptic drugs on driving (IMAP)


Dr. Eisenschenk's research interests in sleep medicine include determination of the mechanisms of sleep-related disorders in patients with movement disorders. Research development includes assessment of morphological anatomical changes in the brain concurrently with identification of neuronal networks (tractography) connecting various regions of the brain that can be correlated with functional measures in patients with sleep apnea. Epidemiological and genetic studies in sleep-related disorders are also under development. Dr. Eisenschenk also performed research on driving performance in sleep-related disorders.

<biography>

Dr. Marie-Carmelle Elie obtained her MD from the State University of New York in Brooklyn with distinction in research. Since then, she has continued to distinguish herself as a scholar and clinician investigator. Following emergency medicine residency at Mount Sinai Medical Center in NY, she completed the prestigious critical care/ trauma fellowship at the R. Adam Cowley Shock Trauma Center at the University of Maryland, and obtained her certification in Hospice -Palliative and End-of-Life Care for Emergency Medicine. In addition, she is a registered diagnostic medical sonographer (RDMS).


Dr. Elie's research focuses on the biomarker detection and the prevention of complications often suffered by critical care patients. She is an expert at designing systems to prevent errors in the critical care setting, and has a track record of successful interdepartmental collaborations that result in streamlining acute care in the ED. As co-chair of the hospital sepsis committee, she is spearheading the hospital-wide sepsis protocols, has instituted the emergency department sepsis alert, and is engaged in plans to establish a community-wide program that will engage neighboring facilities and the pre-hospital system.


Dr. Elie is involved in numerous high profile clinical trials. She is a member of the US Critical Illness and Injury Trials Group (USCIITG). She is currently the site principal investigator (PI) for the LIPS-A study, an NIH funded trial that investigates the use of aspirin in preventing acute lung injury, and the PI for Biomarkers of Pediatric Sepsis trial, funded by a competitive University of Florida Faculty Research Development Grant. She has served as co-investigator for a number of critical care trials including PROWESS-II, the study of drotrecogin alfa in septic shock, and PROMISES (Progenitor Endothelial Cells as a Marker of Endothelial injury and Repair), which examines angiogenic markers of hypoxia and endothelial injury and the mechanism of repair in sepsis. Dr. Elie has also lead research efforts in the area of nosocomial patterns of transmission of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), specifically in the health care setting. Her impressive research portfolio has been supported by continuous grant funding since 2008.


In addition to her research accomplishments, Dr. Elie is a masterful clinician educator. Her bedside teaching and formal didactics consistently win acclaim for their clarity, contemporary themes, and delivery. What is remarkable about her approach is her enviable ability to distill complicated and often controversial concepts into material that is relevant to the daily practice of the clinician. This incredible agility in thought has been recognized again and again by Faculty of the Year awards.

<biography>

Dr. Irene M. Estores completed her Integrative Medicine fellowship at the University of Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine, the nationally recognized program of Dr. Andrew Weil, as a Bravewell Fellow. She is also a specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM and R) and completed her residency training at the Sinai Hospital- Johns Hopkins Hospital Inter-institutional program in PM and R. She received her initial acupuncture training at the University of Miami Center for Complementary and Integrative Medicine and has applied this to the management of both musculoskeletal and neuropathic pain. She has worked as clinical faculty in academic medical centers, in federal hospital systems, and in a community outreach clinic prior to her current position as Medical Director of the Integrative Medicine Program at the University of Florida Health System.


Irene's interest in integrative medicine grew out of self-exploration of other healing and belief systems, the deepening of her spiritual practice of prayer, self-reflection and meditation, and a mindful experience of both the good and bad things that have happened in her life as an individual and as a physician. She considers her practice of medicine as a vocation and a spiritual path.


As part of her commitment to nurture her own body, mind, and spirit, she racewalks, keeps a daily prayer/journaling/ meditative reading practice, laughs at her husband's jokes, cooks with her sons, and walks any labyrinth she can find.

<biography>

Jeffrey Fair, M.D., professor and chief of the division of transplantation surgery, joined the University of Florida College of Medicine in 2012. Prior to joining UF Health, he served as director of translational research at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center's department of surgery and as a professor of surgery at the University of California at Los Angeles' David Geffen School of Medicine.


Dr. Fair earned his medical degree and completed his general surgery training at East Carolina School of Medicine. He then completed a fellowship in kidney and liver transplantation at The Johns Hopkins Hospital and a fellowship in pancreas transplantation at the University of Minnesota Hospital.


Before working at UCLA and Cedars-Sinai, he was a faculty member in the department of surgery at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill. During that time, Dr. Fair rose to the rank of professor and served as the chief of transplantation. Dr. Fair served in the U.S. Army Reserve Medical Corps from 1990 to 2004.


Dr. Fair is a member of the American Society of Transplantation. He also is a member of the International Society for Stem Cell Research, Southern Surgical Association and the International Pediatric Transplantation Association, as well as a fellow of the American College of Surgeons.


An accomplished transplant surgeon and an innovator in liver stem cell therapies, Dr. Fair is using stem cells to restore function to damaged or diseased livers through gene therapy, and to grow new, healthy liver cells in patients whose livers do not function properly. Advances in this research may one day help some patients avoid liver transplants.

<research>

Dr. Fedele's research broadly focuses on family adjustment to pediatric chronic illness. He is particularly interested in the psychosocial aspects of pediatric chronic illnesses including how health behaviors, adherence to treatment regimens, and the child-caregiver relationship impact adjustment and morbidity. Dr. Fedele's current research predominantly focuses on youth diagnosed with asthma and their families. He is interested in developing and evaluating family-based interventions for youth diagnosed with asthma that may improve weight status and adherence to controller medications. Dr. Fedele is also interested in examining linkages between sleep, weight status, and components of disease management in youth diagnosed with asthma.

<biography>

Kevin Fennelly, MD, MPH is Director of the Nontuberculous Mycobacterial Disease Program and Associate Professor of Medicine in the new Division of Mycobacteriology and the Southeastern Tuberculosis Center in the Department of Medicine and is a faculty member of the Emerging Pathogens Institute at the University of Florida.He is also a Senior Associate in Environmental and Occupational Health at the VA National Center for Occupational Health and Infection Control (COHIC). He was recruited in January 2010 from the New Jersey Medical School-UMDNJ in Newark, where he served as the Interim Director of the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine and a Principal Investigator in the Center for Emerging and Re-Emerging Pathogens. After a combined pulmonary and occupational-environmental medicine fellowship at the University of California, San Francisco, he joined the faculty at the National Jewish Medical and Research Center in Denver and was then recruited to UMDNJ in 2001. He has clinical expertise in managing multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacterial infections, and he has served as a consultant on TB Infection Control and preventing TB transmission in South Africa, Botswana, Russia, and Mexico.


His major research interests are the variability of infectiousness and transmission of tuberculosis (TB). He has a patent pending on a diagnostic device to collect infectious aerosols from patients with respiratory infections, and he has recently developed an improved method of microscopy for the diagnosis of TB. Laboratory-based research in progress includes studying the airborne survival of pathogens using a newly developed model of airborne dessication stress, use of viability stains for microscopy of mycobacteria, and quantitative microscopy of elastin fibers in sputum as a marker of lung destruction. His clinical studies outside the laboratory have been conducted not only in the U.S. but in Kampala, Uganda; Vitoria, Brazil; and Brisbane, Australia.

<biography>

Dr. Foote is one of the few neurosurgeons in the world with fellowship training in both movement disorders neurology (Emory University) and movement disorders neurosurgery (Grenoble, France). He is a materials science engineer and a specialist in stereotactic and functional neurosurgery. His research explores the application of computers and advanced technology to the solution of neurosurgical problems, and his work in the fields of stereotactic radiosurgery and deep brain stimulation (DBS) has produced over 126 peer-reviewed publications. Dr. Foote's current research focus is on novel applications of DBS technology, optimization of global DBS outcomes, and neurophysiological and micro-anatomical characterization of functional brain circuitry. His
<em>NIH-sponsored</em>
<em>research</em>
includes projects applying and optimizing DBS therapy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, severe tremor secondary to multiple sclerosis, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and Tourette syndrome. He is also participating in
<em>industry-sponsored</em>
<em>studies</em>
investigating the application of DBS to treat medically refractory depression, early Alzheimer's dementia, and refractory Parkinsonian gait disorders, as well as investigational trials of novel DBS hardware.



Kelly Foote was born in Salt Lake City on May 17, 1966. He attended the University of Utah College of Engineering, from which he graduated cum laude in 1991. He graduated from the University of Utah College of Medicine in 1995, where he was honored with the Florence M. Strong award in recognition of his outstanding qualities as a physician dedicated to patients. He completed his neurosurgical residency at the University of Florida in 2001, including one year of dedicated training in stereotactic and functional neurosurgery, after which he obtained fellowship training in deep brain stimulation at the Universit and eacute; Joseph Fourier in Grenoble and in movement disorders neurology at Emory University in Atlanta, two of the world's leading centers for such studies. Dr. Foote joined the University of Florida neurosurgery faculty in July 2002, where he has performed over 850 deep brain stimulator implantations.

<biography>

Dr. Larry J. Fowler joined UF Pathology Laboratories after working 17 years at the University of Texas Health Science Center (UTHSC) in San Antonio, Texas, where he served as a residency program director from 1996 to 2009 and as a co-director of the cytopathology fellowship from 1994 to 2009.


His training began with medical school at Wayne State School of Medicine in Detroit, Michigan. After medical school, Dr. Fowler completed an internal medicine residency in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and spent several years in private practice in Hillsdale, Michigan. In 1988, he pursued an opportunity in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where he completed both a pathology residency, as well as a fellowship in cytopathology. After completing his second residency and fellowship, he began his pathology career at UTHSC, where he remained until joining UF Health Pathology Laboratories in the fall of 2009.


Dr. Fowler has produced numerous publications, including:


Several book chapters;
Multiple original articles and abstracts;
Book reviews; and
Public talks and lectures


His primary areas of interest include endocrine pathology and cytopathology, as well as head and neck pathology; applications of proteomics and ancillary testing in neoplastic and non-neoplastic cytopathology; and the use of computer-based educational tools for residents, medical students and cytotechnologists.

<research>

In 1986, Friedman began collaborative work with Francis J. Bova, Ph.D., which led to the development of the patented UF radiosurgery system. The system, known as LINAC Scalpel, assists with localizing, planning and treating intracranial tumors using computer software and a specially designed linear accelerator. The LINAC Scalpel has become one of the most popular commercial radiosurgery systems worldwide and has improved the accuracy of high-dose radiation delivered to brain tumors, with very little of the dose reaching normal brain structures. Friedman and Bova received the 1990 UF College of Medicine Clinical Research Prize in recognition of this accomplishment. Friedman is the leader of a multidisciplinary radiosurgery team, which has treated more than 3,500 patients, published more than 250 papers and chapters, produced many international meetings and educated hundreds of visiting physicians.

Representative protocols include studies in colon, rectal, pancreatic, esophagogastric and hepatobiliary cancers. These novel therapies hold the promise of becoming the next breakthrough in cancer patient care.


Personalized Oncology

As cancer care becomes more complex, focus on a tailored approach to individualized treatments which maximize benefit while minimizing risk is critical. Research involving the identification of specific markers or elements of a patient or their cancer which will predict, in advance, response to a given therapy is an area of active investigation. The incorporation of new molecular markers, gene expression profiling, and pharmacogenomics into clinical care will help to provide patients with truly personalized care.


Quality of Life and Decision Making

Patients and their loved ones facing the new diagnosis of a cancer face a variety of potentially overwhelming treatment options and decisions. Collaboration with behavioral scientists, clinical psychologists, and others are helping to break down the complex process of decision making in an attempt to determine how best to deliver treatment options and maximize quality of life.


Educating the Next Generation of Oncologists

The next generation holds the keys to continuing the work currently ongoing in cancer biology, therapeutics, and patient care. Development of novel educational tools, training modules, and advanced curricula aimed at providing these oncologists-in-training with the skills needed to practice state of the art medicine while maintaining the humanism and sensitivity required for being entrusted with the honor of caring for patients with cancer is an area of ongoing professional and research interest.

Dr. Glover's clinical practice is focused on inflammatory and allergic gastrointestinal disorders. In particular, she is interested in the role of food and environmental allergies in chronic abdominal pain and inflammatory bowel disease. She currently has one individual grant application and several collaborative grant applications that are pending to address these topics Dr. Glover's research focuses on improving the understanding of how specific mechanical and luminal factors in the tumor microenvironment of colon cancer increase tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Currently, her NIH funded research is focused on how the mechanical features underlying malignant cells at the luminal interface influence tumor spread. The theory behind this project is that under normal circumstances cells in the colon, including colonic stem cells, follow a strict mechanical axis wherein they migrate from the bottom of the crypt to the top. In the setting of cancer, the axis is distorted and cells are permitted to move in both a two- and three-dimensional fashion. As such, significant changes occur in the topography underlying cells on the luminal side of a tumor. The data, thus far, suggests that these changes significantly alter mechanosensation and motility of cells and creates a pro-invasive cellular phenotype. Overall, Dr. Glover's clinical and research interests are focused on understanding the role of gut microenvironment in both non-neoplastic and neoplastic gastrointestinal disorders.

<biography>

Dr. Gonzalez-Peralta was born in Cuba and emigrated to the U.S. as a refugee in 1969. After living in New Jersey for six months, his family moved to Miami, where he spent the remainder of his childhood and adolescent years. After graduating valedictorian from Miami Jackson High School in 1977, he pursued a career goal to become a physician at Cornell University, where he earned a BA in Chemistry (1981). He worked as a state health inspector and chemist at Key Pharmaceuticals, before enrolling in the School of Medicine at Universidad Central del Este (Dominican Republic) in 1982. He received his medical degree in 1985, and became certified by the ECFMG in 1986. Dr. Gonzalez-Peralta first became interested in Pediatrics through his interactions with children in medical school when he discovered a special talent in working with young patients and found such experience exceedingly gratifying. Accordingly, he began his post-graduate work in Pediatrics at Cook County (Chicago, IL) in 1987, where he completed two years of training. In order to broaden the subspecialty knowledge base and to be "closer to home", Dr. Gonzalez-Peralta then moved to the University of Florida in 1990, where he completed the residency in Pediatrics. At the University of Florida Dr. Gonzalez-Peralta also served as Chief Resident, completed training in Pediatric Gastroenterology and joined the faculty in July 1994 as an Assistant Professor. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 2000 and Professor in 2008 and Assistant Dean of the Office of Diversity and Health Disparity in 2011.


Administratively, Dr. Gonzalez-Peralta has been the director of Pediatric Hepatology (a section developed within the Division of Gastroenterology) since its creation in 2000. The "Liver Service" provides inpatient and outpatient care to all children with liver disorders and transplantation in our institution. In 2006 he expanded the Hepatology services by establishing a Liver Clinic at Nemours Children's Clinic and in 2008 at Arnold Palmer Hospital (in Orlando, Florida). In addition, Dr. Gonzalez-Peralta served as the director of the Pediatric Gastroenterology Fellowship Training Program from 1997 to 2004. In that capacity, he oversaw the successful re-accreditation process for the program without incident. He is actively involved within the North American Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (National Councilor), the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (Chair Elect, Pediatric Interest Group) and the Latin American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition. During his tenure as faculty, Dr. Gonzalez-Peralta has served as mentor to several pediatric residents and medical students.

Dr. Gonz and aacute;lez-Peralta academic pursuits are focused on developing a research and clinical program in Pediatric Hepatology. His initial laboratory work defined the importance of immune-mediated mechanisms in the pathogenesis of liver-cell damage in chronic hepatitis C. His laboratory also developed a novel technique to study HCV heterogeneity (quasispecies) based on single-strand conformational polymorphism. Using this technique, his group was one of the first to demonstrate that HCV heterogeneity played an important role in the pathobiology of this viral infection, particularly as it pertained to treatment response. Despite progress of the understanding of the molecular biology of HCV infection, it became apparent that the study of HCV replication and pathogenesis was hampered by a lack of a suitable animal or
<em>in vitro</em>
model of viral infection. Thus, his laboratory then focused on developing an efficient cell culture model of HCV replication, with financial support from the NIH, University of Florida and the Blowitz-Ridgeway Foundation. Although Dr. Gonz and aacute;lez-Peralta derived very encouraging preliminary results in the research laboratory, he began to 'miss' the interactions with his patients and their families. Accordingly, as a way to reconcile personal and academic-research interests, Dr. Gonz and aacute;lez-Peralta became actively involved in studying the clinical impact of HCV infection in children. With support from the pharmaceutical industry and NIH, he has participated in several investigator-initiated and industry-sponsored trials of interferon and pegylated interferon alone or with ribavirin. Through the participation in the NIH-sponsored PEDS-C consortium, his group spearheaded pivotal studies assessing the effects of HCV infection and antiviral therapy on the quality of life of children infected with this virus. More recently he has also focused on studying hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in children. He is actively involved in trials assessing pharmacokinetic, safety, and efficacy of nucleos(t)ide in children with chronic HBV infection. In addition, his team has been an active member in the Studies for Liver Transplantation (SPLIT), a consortium of North American centers that prospectively tracks the outcome of children who need (and undergo) liver replacement.

<biography>
Assistant Professor
Student Mental Health

Originally from Indiana, Dr. Gooch received his undergraduate degree in biology from the University of Southern Indiana. He then attended Oklahoma State University College of Osteopathic Medicine (OSU-COM) and stayed in Tulsa for a traditional rotating internship.


Dr. Gooch completed Psychiatry residency at the University of Florida (UF) where he was chief resident in his fourth year. He continued his training in a Forensic Psychiatry Fellowship at UF. His areas of specialty continue to be forensic psychiatry, psychopharmacology, student mental health issues, and school violence. He is Board Certified in General Psychiatry and Forensic Psychiatry by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology.


Since joining faculty in November of 2005, the majority of Dr. Gooch's clinical work is in the outpatient setting where he provides direct patient care and supervision of resident physicians. His primary clinical site is UF's Student Mental Health Clinic, which serves one of the country's largest student populations. He also provides weekend/holiday coverage for an adult inpatient/dual diagnosis treatment facility (Vista) via a rotating attending call schedule.


As a consultant to the University's Threat Assessment Team, Dr. Gooch is involved in risk assessment of students that may pose a threat to the University or others. In light of the Virginia Tech tragedy and other school shootings, there has been an increasing emphasis regarding school violence. Dr. Gooch is also a member of the Medical Withdrawal Committee. Like the Threat Assessment Team the committee is multidisciplinary (psychiatry, psychology, housing, academic affairs) with its primary role being to evaluate and provide recommendations for those students that cannot succeed academically due to significant psychiatric/medical disability.


In addition to his work at Student Mental Health, Dr. Gooch is involved with the Division of Forensic Psychiatry. He participates in weekly seminars and is involved in direct fellow/resident/medical student supervision. He performs both civil and criminal cases as a supervisor or direct examiner.

<biography>

My research interests have been in the area of caries diagnosis and preservation of tooth structure using minimally invasive restorative techniques through translational and clinical research applications.


The National Dental Practice-based Research Network (The NDPBRN) is a consortium of participating practices and organizations committed to advancing knowledge of dental practice. I have had the privilege to be associated with Dental Network since its inception and it has allowed me to investigate pressing issues in clinical care while offering the unique opportunity to collaborate with investigators throughout the US and abroad. Most importantly The Dental Network has made it possible to study "real-life" and evidence-based dentistry through the input of over 1,400 private practitioners. As a lead-researcher at The Dental Network, I have been designing clinical trials including the very first study of the entire network involving diagnosis and treatment of dental caries. I have led another five studies, which aimed to address the decision-making processes and approaches used by practitioners in the restoration process. The long-term goal of these studies is to establish evidence-based criteria for the diagnosis and treatment of dental caries as well as to develop guidelines for caries risk assessment and preventive strategies to reduce the burden of dental caries.


As the College of Dentistry advances its collaboration with the Health Sciences Center through the Clinical and Translation Science Award, The Dental Network initiative augments the research efforts as it provides a wide and diverse pool of practitioners with various practice types and patients from various social economical status and demographics. Additionally, I intend to collaborate with the experience built through The Dental Network as other Colleges from the Health Science Center further develop practice-based research.

<research>

Dr. Heldermon's primary focus is on developing new therapeutic strategies using gene therapy and stem cell therapy for patients with inherited diseases such as lysosomal storage disorders and hemophilias. He is focused on studying the frequent cell transfer between mother and fetus during gestation that establish microchimerism and is determining ways to modulate the level of this chimerism to enable therapy of disease. Through the use of gene replacement, he hopes to correct the underlying deficiencies underpinning the disease manifestations.



Additionally he is studying the spread of breast malignancies through the use of xenografting. By studying the spread of tumors from breast cancer patients in mice, he hopes to determine if metastases is determined by tumor specific or host factors. This model will allow identification of what factors are important in tumor spread and localization. Additionally, the model will allow testing of therapeutic agents. The goal is to identify new targets for therapy to personalize oncologic therapeutics.

<biography>

Daniel J. Hoh, M.D., is an assistant professor of neurosurgery at the University of Florida and the Malcom Randall Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Gainesville and a joint assistant professor of neuroscience at the University of Florida. He was awarded a bachelor's degree in psychology from Stanford University and a doctor of medicine degree from Columbia University. Hoh completed his internship and residency training in neurological surgery at the University of Southern California. During residency, he also completed a neurotrauma and spinal cord injury fellowship at Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center. After residency he completed both neurosurgery and orthopaedic spine fellowships with Edward Benzel, M.D., chairman of the department of neurosurgery, and Robert McLain, M.D., orthopaedic surgeon, at the Cleveland Clinic Hospital, a nationally renowned comprehensive spine center. During fellowship, Hoh gained specialty training in the treatment of complex spinal disorders, including spinal cord tumors, spinal deformity, spinal reconstruction, minimally invasive surgery and spinal cord injury.


Hoh provides care to patients with all neurosurgical conditions; however, his primary focus is minimally invasive and complex spine surgery. He specializes in applying innovative surgical techniques and novel technologies for the treatment of spinal degenerative, trauma, deformity, tumor, rheumatologic and infectious disorders.


His primary research interest is the investigation of novel treatment strategies for spinal cord injury, including spinal cord regeneration as well as neurologic rehabilitation. Hoh also has served as a member of the editorial board for noted scientific neurosurgical journals, as well as committees for national neurosurgical organizations. He is a member of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons, Congress of Neurologic Surgeons, the AANS/CNS Joint Section of the Disorders of the Spine and Peripheral Nerves and the AANS/ CNS Joint Section on Neurotrauma and Critical Care.


Hoh performs both minimally invasive and complex spine surgery (laminectomy, discectomy, spinal fusion, disc replacement, spinal instrumentation, spinal reconstruction, deformity correction, tumor removal and kyphoplasty) for the treatment of disorders affecting the cranio-cervical junction, cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine.

<biography>

Dr. Holland joined the UF Department of Emergency Medicine as the Physician Director of Quality in 2012. A long time member of the Gator Nation, she completed both her Bachelor of Science and Master of Education degrees at the University of Florida. She then spent 6 years in the work force as a high school biology teacher and later as a college administrator in Florida and Indiana. She then returned to medical school, earning her M.D. at Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk, VA. She completed her Emergency Medicine residency at the University of Cincinnati and remained in Ohio to complete a 3 year Pediatric Emergency Medicine fellowship at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. Following the completion of her training she remained on the faculty at the University of Cincinnati with a dual academic appointment in the departments of Pediatrics and Emergency Medicine.


Dr. Holland divides her clinical time between both the pediatric and adult emergency departments. Her administrative and research interests focus on quality improvement/patient safety and resident education. Since her arrival at UF Health, she has revamped the peer review process, developed a comprehensive QI/Pt Safety curriculum for the residency program, and strived to incorporate transparency and the "just culture" model into the patient safety reporting process in both the pediatric and adult emergency departments.

<biography>

Robert A. Hromas, MD, graduated from medical school at the University of Texas at Houston, where he was named an Outstanding Student in Internal Medicine.


Dr. Hromas trained in blood cancers at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center with the Nobel Laureate Dr. Don Thomas and then joined the faculty at Indiana University Medical Center for 13 years before going to the University of New Mexico.


He is a leader in translating research into the discovery of new cancer drugs. A professor and chief of hematology-oncology at UNM, Dr. Hromas also was the deputy director of the UNM Cancer Center, the official cancer center of the state of New Mexico and one of only 66 National Cancer Institute-designated centers in the United States.


His background is in molecular genetics and DNA repair. He does drug design in silico, producing and screening cancer drug candidates through computer simulations.


Dr. Hromas recently cloned and characterized several novel DNA repair proteins that play crucial roles in both chemotherapy resistance and in HIV integration. He has created new drugs that target these proteins and is testing them for effectiveness in treating cancers resistant to chemotherapy.


He has published more than 135 research articles, including a recent study in the American Journal of Medicine that the new cancer drug, Gleevec, was being prescribed less often for elderly patients with chronic myeloid leukemia than for younger patients. This finding added to the national debate about age discrimination in cancer treatment.


Dr. Hromas has held more than $8 million in cancer research grants and numerous national medical and scientific leadership positions. He has chaired grant review committees for the National Institutes of Health and for the American Cancer Society. He has served on the Lance Armstrong Foundation Scientific Board and has been elected to the American Society of Clinical Investigation and the Association of American Physicians. He has won multiple awards, including the Indiana University Board of Regents Teacher of the Year and the New Mexico People Caring Award.

<research>

Dr. Hurley's research program broadly covers pain medicine and is focused on the delivery of safe analgesia and outcomes based pain care. These projects and publications range from authorship in my field in the major textbooks to multidisciplinary funded clinical outcomes effectiveness research projects. My secondary goal with many of these projects is to encourage scholarship and improve pain medicine knowledge among trainees at different levels of education. Current granting projects include a Pain and Neuroscience NIH T32 training grant application as well as a multidisciplinary NIH RFA for pain medicine education at the medical school level that will involve educators and researchers across the institution.


Recent publications include the acute and chronic pain chapters in the major Anesthesiology textbooks including Miller's Anesthesia, Barash's Clinical Anesthesia, and Basics of Anesthesia. In the pain literature, I continue to mentor residents, fellows, and junior faculty in multiple pain management texts and have become Associate Editor of both the Essentials of Pain Medicine Text and Section Editor of the previous and current edition of Raj's Practical Management of Pain.


Clinical research collaborations are multidisciplinary involving Orthopedics, Psychology, Anesthesiology, Neurology, and Addiction Medicine. Current funded and submitted NIH projects are based on clinical outcomes and predictors for different pain states including osteoarthritis, postherpetic neuralgia, and central sensitization. Pilot work on predictors and outcome of Spinal Cord Stimulation in Veterans. Collaborations beyond the institution include topics ranging from pain medicine treatments to the perception of pain care in the United States.

I am trained as both an Infectious Disease specialist and as an expert in innate defense against bacterial infection, with a focus on Gram-negative organisms. As an Infectious Disease specialist, I am particularly interested in treatment approaches to multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections. As a researcher, I study the innate defenses against these types of infections. In one project, I study the Bactericidal/Permeability-Increasing protein (BPI) - an endogenous antibiotic found in neutrophils and available in recombinant form. BPI has potent activity against Gram-negative bacteria, including multidrug-resistant clinical isolates I collect.



I have a 3-year grant from the Bankhead-Coley Research Council entitled "The Role of Smoking in the Promotion of Crohn's Disease: A Predisposing Factor to Colon Cancer." The study population consists of Crohn's Disease patients who are seen in the GI clinic at UF and who have been genotyped for the major Crohn's Disease polymorphisms as part of a separate study. In the first part of my study, I am performing chart reviews of these patients to score their disease severity. This scoring system includes smoking status and the data are analyzed based on that variable as well as their genotypes. In the second part of the study, monocyte-derived macrophages from these patients will be assessed for their ability to kill enteric bacteria and elicit pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines.





I have expertise in the area of
<em>Campylobacter jejuni</em>
pathogenesis, and study the role of innate immune mechanisms including reactive nitrogen species, BPI and most recently, autophagy in host defense against
<em>C. jejuni</em>
infection.

<biography>

Dr. Jacobs-Elliott began her academic career by receiving a Bachelor of Science degree from Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University in Tallahassee, Florida. She then pursued a Medical Degree at the University of Miami School of Medicine in Miami, Florida. After graduating from the University of Miami, she completed her psychiatry residency, as well as a Child and Adolescent Psychiatry fellowship at the University of Florida. She currently works at the Student Health Care Center as a staff Psychiatrist.


Recently, Dr. Jacobs-Elliott was co-chair of a search committee for a Student Mental Health Psychiatrist position. She has also participated in various presentations on topics such as Depression in African American Women, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and Mental Health Issues for Women. She plans to continue these in the future. Dr. Jacobs's involvement with the Minority Mentors Program for the university has given her an opportunity to meet with undergraduate freshmen students as well as other university professors and staff from various departments. Due to these contacts she has also done some consulting with a member of the College of Nursing. In the future she plans to continue her service to the university by becoming involved with the admissions process for the University of Florida College of Medicine.

<em>
Clinical Interests:
</em>


Dr. Jacobs-Elliott's clinical interests in psychiatry have changed over the last few years. After completing her training as a child and adolescent psychiatrist, most of Dr. Jacobs work had been with children ages 4-18, who suffered from disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, and anxiety disorders. However since she has been working at the student health care center for the University of Florida Dr. Jacobs has been working with young adults as well as mature adults who are pursuing graduate degrees. This has developed into a wonderful opportunity for her to do work with depression, eating disorders, panic disorders as well as the many different adjustment disorders. She has also worked as part of the treatment team for two specialty areas: eating disorders and survivors of sexual assault and abuse recovery. Dr. Jacobs has continued her interest in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder by working with college students who have that diagnosis and consulting with the Office of Students Affairs, as well as the medical staff at the Health Care Center


<em>
Educational Interests and Accomplishments:
</em>


Dr. Jacobs-Elliott's teaching role is in the context of the supervision she provides to third year medical students when they rotate at the Student Health Care Center as part of their minor Psychiatry rotation. She also supervises psychiatry residents when they rotate at the Student Health Care Center as well.

<research>

The Kang Laboratory focuses on the genetics of muscular dystrophy, and the core project involves gene discovery in limb girdle muscular dystrophy and other muscle diseases. The laboratory makes use of exome and genome sequencing technologies, supplemented as needed by linkage analyses and other approaches. Dr. Kang and his collaborators enroll research subjects with undiagnosed muscle diseases for these studies.


Genes identified in the core project are considered for more in-depth studies to understand the disease processes better and to seek potential therapeutic targets. One such gene is
<em>MEGF10</em>
, which causes a congenital muscle disease with prominent respiratory distress and scoliosis. The laboratory described a family affected by mutations in this gene, and has determined that at least some pathogenic mutations affect tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein product. This gene is expressed in muscle satellite cells, suggesting that manipulations of it or its protein product may have therapeutic implications for muscle disease. Further analyses are ongoing.

<research>

Dr. Kitchens' primary interests have been in the area of hematology, particularly the mechanisms governing bleeding and thrombosis. He has published extensively in these areas and has edited the second edition of the leading textbook in consultative hemostasis and thrombosis. He has been very active in graduate medical education and in leading courses in continuing medical education for internal medicine physicians. The majority of Dr. Kitchens' research focus is in the areas of clinical hemostasis and thrombosis, coagulation testing, pre-operative testing, disorders of platelets, and snake bite envenomation.


Dr. Kitchens' primary clinical efforts are directed toward the myriad hemostatic and thrombotic manifestations that are encountered in tertiary medical centers due to the complexity of transplant medicine, level I trauma, and cancer medicine as well as the rapidly advancing area of clinical thrombosis and hypercoagulability. He sees patients both within the University of Florida Medical Center and as outpatients from the entire Southeast in the consultative center. He also as an interest in envenomation by native poisonous snakes seeing about 30 patients a year. He helped develop the newest snake antivenom which is now regularly employed in this country. He has interests in medical-legal aspects of medical practice.

<biography>

Dr. Virginia Kockler's educational and clinical careers include a variety of clinical and social experiences which complement her skills as a physician-researcher. She studies biology and chemistry as an undergraduate at Covenant College at Lookout Mountain, Georgia. Then, she attended medical school at the University of Virginia and continued on with her pediatric residency at the University of Florida. She is licensed in the state of Florida and is board-certified as a Diplomat with the American Board of Pediatrics.


Her primary research interest is in tobacco prevention and cessation; as such she completed leadership advocacy training in Chicago, Illinois at an American Academy of Pediatrics conference. She is also a core faculty member for the AHEC Tobacco Training and Cessation program for medical students. In 2010, she was the recipient of a Community Access to Child Health (CATCH) grant from the AAP to help mothers with newborns stop smoking.

<research>

Dr. Ying Li's research interest is to identify potential low-grade stem cell disorders utilizing flow cytometric analyses. Hematopathologic diagnosis of the low-grade stem cell disorders (myelodysplastic syndrome and/or myeloproliferative disorders) is still a challenging process in clinical practice, in that the diagnosis is based on clinical history and certain morphologic features, which are non-specific and may not present in many of the stem cell disorders.

<biography>

Irene A. Malaty, M.D., studied microbiology and psychology at Indiana University in Bloomington, IN. She attended Indiana University School of Medicine on the Notre Dame campus and in Indianapolis, IN. After completing her intern year at St. Vincent's hospital in Indianapolis, she moved to Gainesville for neurology residency and served as chief resident. She completed a fellowship in movement disorders at the University of Florida Gainesville, and joined the faculty thereafter.


She cares for patients with a variety of movement disorders, but has a specialty interest in Tourette syndrome and runs the interdisciplinary clinic for Tourette and tic disorders. Additionally, she focuses on Parkinson disease and is the director of the National Parkinson Foundation Center of Excellence at the University of Florida. She is the site principal investigator of a Quality Improvement Initiative aimed at using longitudinal and comparative data to establish best standards of care for people living with Parkisnon disease.


Regionally, she sits on the executive board of the Florida Society of Neurology, which aims to promote education, advocacy, and outreach in our state to improve care for neurological disoroders. She also serves on the executive committee of the American Academy of Neurology Neuroendocrinology Section, as the Movement Disorder Subsection Chair.


Dr. Malaty is committed to providing quality, state-of-the-art care for all movement disorders, but has specific interests in the non-motor aspects of Parkinson's disease, and in compulsivity as it applies to Tourette's syndrome and other movement disorders. She has many peer reviewed articles and travels the world lecturing on Parkinson's disease, Tourette, botulinum toxin administration, dystonia, and other movement disorders.

<research>

Dr. May's focuses on discovery-driven research involving the molecular mechanisms by which hematopoietic growth factors regulate the cell signaling responsible for efficient cell growth of both normal and malignant/leukemic hematopoietic cells. Dr. May's research is focused on regulation of apoptosis by Bcl2 and other anti- or pro-apoptotic factors. Dr. May also works on the three novel genes discovered by his laboratory: 1.) RAX (PKR-associated protein X) which is the only known cellular activator of PKR; 2.) JAZ (Just-another-zinc finger protein) which is a novel, direct activator of p53; and 3.) KOS (kinase of embryonic stem cells) which is a negative regulator of Ras and a tumor suppressor gene. His research is funded by the NCI and NHLBI of the NIH.


Dr. May also acts as PI for the T32 Training Grant in Cancer Biology which sponsors pre-doctoral candidates and post-doctoral fellows.

Nikolaus McFarland, M.D., Ph.D. joined the UF Department of Neurology (and Neuroscience) and the Center for Movement Disorders and Neurorestoration as an Assistant Professor. He is also a member of the newly formed Center for Translational Research in Neurodegenerative Disease (CTRND) which aims to bring the bench closer to the bedside. He is a fellowship trained movement disorders neurologist.


He graduated from the University of Chicago in 1992 with honors in Biology and election into the Sigma Xi research society. He completed medical and graduate training in the MD/PhD program at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, where he received a merit award for research in thalamic and basal ganglia anatomy. Afterwards he went to the University of Virginia for internship and residency training in neurology, and then to the Massachusetts General Hospital to pursue fellowship training in Movement Disorders and research in Parkinson disease and related disorders at the MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease (MIND). As a Udall Fellow he became the first recipient of the Robert Koch Parkinson Disease research fellowship, and was awarded foundation support from both the American Parkinson Disease Association and Michael J. Fox Foundation for his research. He is now also NIH funded.


His research focuses on understanding the pathological mechanisms of Parkinson disease and related disorders, and in particular the role of alpha-synuclein in cell toxicity and neurodegeneration. His current studies utilize both cellular and preclinical models to study genes and molecules that may enhance or ameliorate alpha-synuclein toxicity. A primary goal of his research is to identify and to develop potential novel therapeutics for Parkinson's disease and related disorders.


In addition, Dr. McFarland has strong clinical interests in Parkinson disease and Atypical Parkinsonisms (Parkinson-plus syndromes), including progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple system atrophy, dementia with Lewy bodies, and corticobasal degeneration. He is spearheading, along with Dr. Chris Hass in Exercise Physiology, the development of an exciting interdisciplinary clinical-research program for PSP and atypical Parkinson's disease through the support of the Allens and several other afflicted families.

<biography>

Alicia Mohr, M.D., is an associate professor in the department of surgery's division of general surgery and part of the acute care surgery team. Prior to joining UF Health, she worked as an associate professor of surgery in the division of trauma/critical care at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School's department of surgery. Dr. Mohr earned her medical degree from the New Jersey Medical School when it was still part of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, and completed her general surgery residency training at the affiliated University Hospital. Following her residency, Dr. Mohr was a fellow in surgical critical care and trauma at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.


During her fourteen years at University Hospital in Newark, New Jersey, she progressed from medical director of the trauma/surgical progressive care unit to program director for the surgical critical care fellowship, and director of the surgical intensive care unit. She also worked as the director of trauma/critical care research at Hackensack University Medical Center.


Dr. Mohr's clinical interests include trauma surgery, surgical critical care and emergency general surgery. These three disciplines encompass acute care surgery, the comprehensive care of emergent, critically-ill surgical patients.


Her research interests are both in basic science as well as translational. She is currently examining the impact of stress following injury and shock on erythropoiesis. Dr. Mohr is an NIH-funded investigator and was the recipient of a NIH mentored research grant and was simultaneously awarded the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma/American College of Surgeons Clowes research award to further support her research.

<research>

Dr. Moreb's areas of specialization in the laboratory research are in drug resistance, gene expression, and cell biology. His research interests and activities have involved laboratory research focused on aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH) isozymes and their role in drug resistance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) as well as cancer cells and more recently as a possible marker for lung cancer stem cell.


In addition, he is active in different clinical research projects. These involve different aspects of stem cell transplantation (SCT) including stem cell mobilization, engraftment, and the use of new methods to improve outcomes after autologous SCT (ASCT) for myeloma. Tandem transplants, post-transplant maintenance therapy, including adoptive immunotherapy and Phase I-III for Multiple Myeloma are his current areas of interest.

Nutrition and the GI environment in the neonate have major effects not only during infancy, but for the entire lifetime of the individual, and this can even span generations due to epigenetic effects. Our lab has several ongoing projects that involve the requirements for certain amino acids such as glutamine and arginine in very low birthweight infants, the effect of various nutrients on subsequent development of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, the effect of the intestinal commnensal microflora and probiotics on intestinal development, and the effects of novel nutritional agents on retinal diseases such as retinopathy of prematurity. Our work spans from evaluation of basic mechanisms of nutrients in cell cultures, studies in animal models and translation of these to and from studies in human infants.

<biography>
Assistant Professor
Medical Director and Associate Chief
Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry
Chief, Psychiatry Consultation-Liaison Services


Dr. Nguyen has said that he sees his role as serving to oversee the clinical care of patients, provide guidance and training for our trainees, manage and supervise the day-to-day clinical operations, all the while being cognizant of financial responsibilities and availability of resources. Another major priority is collaboration with other services and departments. As Chief of the Psychiatry C/L Services, Dr. Nguyen has worked diligently to improve care and treatment for psychiatrically ill patients in the medical and surgical settings. "Good patient care means providing the best medical opinion and treatment available for the patient. But in this day and age, it also must mean being knowledgeable about resources, collaborating appropriately with colleagues, and being mindful of health care costs and dollars. Setting a good example in this is the best type of mentoring for our young doctors."

<em>
Clinical Interests:
</em>


Dr. Nguyen's main clinical interests focus on psychotherapy training for the child and adolescent psychiatry fellows. He supervises the trainees in behavioral modification, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), family therapy, interpersonal therapy (IPT) and psychodynamic psychotherapy: "A non-biological approach to Psychiatry in today's atmosphere of newer medications and managed care is becoming more a lost art form, and it is important for our trainees to be able to conceptualize patients in a more global fashion." His other main area of interest involves the treatment of psychiatric illness in the medical setting.



<em>Research and Scholarly Interests:</em>



Dr. Nguyen has worked on multiple articles and case reports, with a focus on psychosomatic medicine in children and adolescents and has given Grand Rounds in these areas to Internal Medicine and Pediatrics. Dr. Nguyen (along with Drs. White and Bussing) serves on the Florida Best Practice Parameters Committee, regarding setting best practice protocols/standards for the prescribing of psychoactive medications for children and adolescents in the state of Florida. He has participated in multiple clinical trials at the University of Florida, mainly with the child and adolescent population. He is also involved in the research protocols on the child psychiatry inpatient unit, looking at family/parent attitudes towards psychiatric follow-up and its potential effects on recidivism.



<em>Educational Interests and Accomplishments:</em>



Dr. Nguyen believes in the importance of resident training and has been very involved with our adult residents and Child Psychiatry fellows. In the past, he had helped to organize and facilitate the didactic schedule/seminars for the PGY-2 class and the Child Psychiatry fellowship and hadextended many of these seminars to the Pediatric residency. He has given Child Psychiatry lectures to both medical students and physician assistant students. He currently supervisesChild Psychiatry fellowsin weekly individual supervision (IPT, CBT, and psychodynamic psychotherapy) and is the Psychotherapy Lecture Series supervisor for the Child Psychiatry fellowship. He was recently named an Exemplary Teacher by the UF College of Medicine in 2008 and Teacher of the Year by the Psychiatry residents in 2007 and Mentor of the Year in 2009.

Pediatric gastroenterologist Donald Novak seeks to better understand whether fetal nutrition plays a role in the origin of certain diseases that surface in adulthood.


As alarm rises over soaring rates of obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure, scientists are eager to determine whether nature or nurture, or some combination, spurs development of these conditions.


"There are many people around the world who don't have enough protein in their diets, and malnutrition is a major cause of babies being born small around the world," says Novak, a professor with the division of pediatric gastroenterology at UF?s College of Medicine. "There is a lot of evidence that when infants are born small, compared to their counterparts, they have a higher risk of these specific disorders."


One possible answer: What mothers eat when they are pregnant could alter the function of key genes in their offspring, even without changing the genes? fundamental DNA sequence.


Novak and his colleagues have found from ongoing animal studies that a high-protein maternal diet predisposes offspring to health problems such as insulin resistance in adulthood, a precursor to diabetes. Other findings show that protein deprivation during pregnancy also is linked to the development of larger body type in rats, a tendency that persisted for two generations.


The work of UF researchers and others also raises questions about standard care of premature babies and newborns whose growth in the womb was retarded. The suggested protein intake for these infants is relatively high, to help spur "catch-up" growth. In addition, babies who are fed formula tend to take in higher protein levels than those who are fed breast milk.


Metabolic syndrome is a major public health problem characterized by a combination of abdominal obesity, high blood pressure and insulin resistance. Novak and his colleagues are looking at how maternal diet might alter gene function and influence the transmission of disease to subsequent generations.


"Genes are tightly wound around proteins; if those proteins are altered in certain ways, it's more difficult for the gene to be active or for new proteins to be made from the gene," Novak says.

Nearly 1.6 million Americans were diagnosed with cancer last year, and nearly 600,000 died from the disease, according to the National Cancer Institute. Experts estimate that as many as 90 percent of those deaths were from metastases, when the cancer has spread from the original disease site to other organs. These data seem to support conventional wisdom about cancer -- that once it appears in a different location from where it began it is systemic, and can only be treated palliatively, usually with chemotherapy alone.


This line of thought is being challenged by some visionary oncologists who don't believe all tumors are alike. They reject the notion that a diagnosis of metastatic cancer is an automatic terminal diagnosis.


"The dogma is that this type of disease is incurable and that if there's a metastatic tumor in one organ, then others must be present throughout the body," said Paul Okunieff, M.D., director of the UF Shands Cancer Center and chairman of the UF College of Medicine's department of radiation oncology. "It's considered an all-or-none phenomenon, but the fact is, this view is probably not correct. We need to think about metastasis like we think about the primary tumor: determine how much it has spread, then decide whether it's treatable based on existing technology."


Dr. Okunieff is an international expert in the treatment of metastatic disease and has developed what we believe to be the first multidisciplinary program and clinic devoted to the treatment of metastatic disease. Dr. Roi Dagan, the program leader, will work with Dr. Okunieff to develop surgical, medical and radiation approaches for comprehensive treatment of patients with oligometastases -- or metastatic disease that in the very early stages with a few, small tumors.


This joint program between Gainesville and UF Proton Therapy Institute in Jacksonville will include the commissioning of a VERO system, the second in the United States. VERO allows for robotically controlled, real-time stereotactic targeting of moving objects within the body. Better targeting means that a higher dose of radiation can be delivered to the tumor with a lower dose to the adjacent normal tissue.


The clinical program will be complemented by a basic science program aimed at identifying molecular markers predictive of metastases, developing interventions that can prevent subclinical metastases from progressing, and selecting screening programs for cancer patients at high risk for oligometastases.


Dr. Okunieff thinks of the future this way: "Our new technologies can actually follow in three dimensions with sub-millimeter accuracy, and in real time, a lesion that is moving while you breathe or while your heart is beating. I have a vision, which we will be implementing soon, that our cancer patients will be treated quickly, accurately and curatively. Imagine you are the physician. A patient has a PET scan, and you find they have one new tumor. You target it, you send them into the second room, you kill it and you send them home. With that technology, before that patient even gets home, the tumor is dead -- with at least an 80% likelihood. This changes the entire dynamic. Imagine now being the cancer patient and your spouse asks: 'How did your visit go today?' And you say, 'I had one spot and they killed it. Let's have dinner.'


"It's a much better way to go home. It's very reasonable to expect and to dream that the UF Shands Cancer Center will become the pre-eminent cancer center for the treatment of metastatic disease in the country. I think we can be as great as we dream to be. And so I'm dreaming big."

<biography>

David W. Pincus, MD, PhD, is the Chief of Pediatric Neurosurgery. He was born in New Haven, CT in 1963. He grew up in Massachusetts where he attended high school at Deerfield Academy. After graduating from Yale College with a B.S. degree in biology, Dr. Pincus obtained M.D. and Ph.D. degrees from Cornell University. His Ph.D. thesis work focused on the development of precursor cells (stem cells) in the nervous system. He then pursued a neurosurgical residency at the Neurological Institute of New York at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. During his residency training he continued his work with neuronal precursor cells, now with human brain samples, and received the Congress of Neurological Surgeons' Resident Award in 1996.


After completing his chief residency at Columbia, Dr. Pincus served as a pediatric neurosurgical fellow at Children's National Medical Center in Washington, DC. He then accepted a position as an attending at Children's where he remained for one year prior to being asked to join the Department of Neurological Surgery at the University of Florida. As the primary pediatric neurosurgeon at the University of Florida, Dr. Pincus takes care of all neurosurgical problems in children.


Dr. Pincus is board certified by both the American Board of Neurological Surgeons and the American Board of Pediatric Neurosurgeons and is a member of the American Society of Pediatric Neurosurgeons. He cares for patients from birth through 21 years of age.

<research>

Dr. Reeves' and associates' research focuses on the mechanisms of autoimmunity in systemic autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), polymyositis, and Sjogren's syndrome. They have found that the hydrocarbon oil pristane induces a lupus-like syndrome in normal mice characterized by the production of high levels of antinuclear antibodies specific for SLE as well as immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis and arthritis. Using cytokine knockout mice, they have found that pristane-induced lupus is strongly dependent on IL-6 and interferon-g . The hypothesis that different manifestations of lupus (clinical and serological) result from the overproduction of these and other cytokines is being investigated in patients from the UF Lupus Research Center and in animal models in order to understand the interrelationships between genetic predisposition and environmental triggers of autoimmune disease.

<biography>

Dr. Reisfield specializes in the management of chronic cancer and non-cancer pain in individuals with concurrent substance use disorders, dividing his time between the University of Florida's Gainesville campus and the urban campus in Jacksonville. He is dedicated to providing care of the highest quality and to advancing the educational and research aims of the pain and substance abuse disciplines.


Dr. Reisfield's major research interest is medication adherence monitoring and he is the author of more than fifty book chapters, journal articles, and abstracts.


He believes that pain has both physical and emotional dimensions, and that the experience of pain is determined by the interaction of the pain with social, environmental, occupational, familial, and psychological factors. He feels that key goals for patients with chronic pain include reducing the pain, improving function in major life spheres, enhancing quality of life, and reducing dependence on the healthcare system.

Dr. Riggs participates in multidisciplinary treatment programs in head and neck cancer, lung cancer, esophageal cancer, thyroid cancer, and sarcomas of soft tissue and bone, in both the UF/Shands and VA medical systems. He is a member of the UF/Shands Cancer Center, and serves the University as Vice-Chair of the medical IRB, with expertise in oncology clinical trials, biomedical ethics, and pharmacoeconomics. He teaches biomedical ethics to medical students, and participates in teaching physical diagnosis to medical students and oncology topics to trainees in the residency and fellowship programs.


Multidisciplinary collaborative trials in head and neck cancer constitute the primary focus of Dr. Riggs' current research efforts. He participates in local and national investigational trials in sarcomas and prostate cancer, as well. Integration of targeted therapies into traditional combined-modality treatment programs for head and neck and thyroid cancers are proceeding through University of Florida clinical trials, and expansion of these approaches into esophageal cancer and sarcoma chemotherapy trials is anticipated.

<biography>

Scott A. Rivkees, MD, earned his undergraduate degree from Rutgers University and his medical degree from the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in 1982. He completed his residency training and fellowships in pediatrics, pediatric endocrinology and neuroscience at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital.


Prior to joining the University of Florida, he served as a professor and associate chair of pediatrics for research at the Yale University School of Medicine. He also led the department's section on developmental endocrinology and biology and served as director of the Yale Child Health Research Center and the Yale Pediatric Thyroid Center. Prior to joining Yale in 1996, he held appointments at Harvard Medical School and Indiana University.


An internationally renowned expert on developmental biology and pediatric endocrinology, Dr. Rivkees leads a robust clinical and basic science research program. Key areas of study in his lab are the prevention of brain injury in premature infants, the effects of adenosine on the developing embryo, circadian biology and thyroid diseases. In 2009, he detected a safety problem with a common thyroid medication. One in 2,000 children who were on the medication were going into liver failure or dying each year, and his discovery led to global changes in medical practice.


A fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics, he has been named one of America's Best Doctors and reg; as well as one of America's Top Pediatricians and one of New York's Best Doctors. His work with pediatric thyroid disease has led to new treatment guidelines in thyroid cancer and Graves' disease worldwide.


Dr. Rivkees received the George H. Cook Distinguished Alumnus Award from Rutgers University and the Distinguished Alumnus Award from the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. He has been elected to the American Society for Clinical Investigation and to be a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He has testified before the U.S. Senate on pediatric issues.


Dr. Rivkees has more than 280 publications and continuous funding from the National Institutes of Health for more than 26 years.

Dr. Rivkees developed a research program that is focused in three major areas: circadian biology, adenosinergic influences on brain injury of prematurity and the discovery of novel pediatric diagnostics and therapeutics. He discovered that the biological clock of preterm infants is responsive to low intensity lighting, leading to new treatment practices for preterm infants. He discovered that A1 adenosine receptor activation induces periventricular white matter injury (PWMI)-the most common neurological disorder affecting premature infants. He has recently discovered adverse effects on body composition and heart function related to prenatal caffeine exposure, findings reported widely in the press. Recently, he started a new research program aimed at the development of novel pediatric diagnostics and therapeutics. Moist recently the Rivkees laboratory has begun to focus on the risks and adverse events associated with Graves' disease therapy in children and during during pregnancy.

Ramon L. Rodriguez, M.D., Director of the Movement Disorders Clinic and Clinical Trials Center, completed his B.S. in Biology from the University of Puerto Rico and graduated Magna Cum Laude from the University of Puerto Rico, School of Medicine in San Juan, PR. He went on to complete an Internal Medicine Internship and Neurology Residency at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, Texas. It was there that he developed an interest in Parkinson's disease and Movement Disorders and pursued a Fellowship in Movement Disorders and Surgery for Movement Disorders at the University of Florida Gainesville.


Besides his interests in surgery for movement disorders, Dr. Rodriguez has special interest in the translation of the latest advances in movement disorders research and the application into clinical practice. He is also experienced in the administration of Botulinum toxin for dystonia and spasticity. The main goal in his practice is to provide the highest level of care and improve the quality of life of his patients.


Dr. Rodriguez directs the Tyler's Hope Dystonia Center at UF and the Huntington's disease clinic.


In addition to clinical care, Dr. Rodriguez is investigator in multiple clinical trials attempting to find ways to delay the progression of Parkinson's disease as well as development of new therapies. He is also an Associate Professor at the Department of Neurology and is Board Certified in Neurology by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology.


Dr. Rodriguez directs 30+ clinical trials and 7 full time clinical trials coordinators in the Center for Movement Disorders and Neurorestoration. He is author or co-author on more than 50 research publications. He travels the world lecturing on clinical trials, scales administration, botulinum toxin, and novel therapies for movement disorders.

Dr. Ross' laboratory research interests focus on biomaterials and engineering in regard to renal replacement therapies. Currently his group is studying organ regeneration by the use of pluripotent precursor cells seeded into decellularized intact kidneys. Mouse and rat models are utilized to investigate stem cell differentiation and remodeling of scaffold basement membranes, with xenotransplantation being the ultimate goal. Previous research efforts from his multidisciplinary group have included the invention and licensing of a polyethylene glycol technology that can be used therapeutically for immunoadsorption and diagnostically for the detection of trace quantities of toxins.


Dr. Ross also has long-standing clinical research activity in improvements in extracorporeal renal replacement technology. His group has patented a safety device for detecting disconnection-associated venous hemorrhage in hemodialysis patients, as well as a photoplethysmography instrument to monitor vascular volume during ultrafiltration. Biomaterials and engineering projects have also included: the development bioimpedance technology for monitoring intra-abdominal fluid or hemorrhage; a new design for dialysis vascular access needles, and new phosphate-binding polymers. Direct clinical patient research studies have focused on the nutrition of dialysis patients. He has investigated the metabolism of a variety of nutrients, including pyridoxine, vitamin C, oxalate, glutathione, cysteine, and carnitine, and has published methods to improve nutrition in these patient populations.

<biography>

William R. Rout M.D., associate professor of psychiatry and surgery, was selected to be the College of Medicine's first Chief of the UF Health Pain and Addiction Medicine Consult Service. According to Addiction Medicine Chief, Scott Teitelbaum, M.D. " We are all very lucky to have the chance to train (and also learn from) Bob Rout. He has so much surgical, pain and recovery experience that with his addiction training, he will be an important factor in intervention, prevention and treatment at UF Health. He looks forward to working closely in this new capacity with his many friends and colleagues at UF Health."


Rout, an associate professor of surgery, who joined UF in 1985, served as chief of surgery at the Malcom Randall Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center during his tenure. Rout was a surgical pioneer as he introduced laparoscopic abdominal surgery at the UF College of Medicine and UF Health . He was one of the first in the state of Florida to perform a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and the first in the state to perform a TEM, transanal endoscopic microsurgical, resection of a rectal tumor.


After completing his addiction medicine fellowship under the direction of Dr. Teitelbaum in addiction medicine and Gary Reisfield, M.D. in addiction and pain, Dr. Rout was selected to be the COM's first Chief of the UF Health Pain and Addiction Medicine Consult Service.

<biography>

As a general pediatrician I take care of children from birth through age 21. I have a strong emphasis on preventative health care which includes not only physical health but also developmental, behavioral and emotional well being. I strive to form a cooperative relationship with the parents in order to help the child to reach their full potential. I encourage questions and encourage parents to become more knowledgable about their child's health and development. I have particular interests in breast feeding and attachment parenting. I also work with LGBT patients and families.

<biography>

Dr. Salgado earned M.D. degree in his home country of Colombia and later traveled to Pennsylvania for his post graduate training. He completed his specialization in internal medicine at Geisinger Medical Center, after which he was honored to serve as the chief medical resident for one year in the same institution, in recognition of his leadership, teaching and patient care skills. He then moved to Pittsburgh, PA where he completed a combined training in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine with emphasis in advanced lung disease. He successfully completed a track dedicated to the care of pre and post lung transplant recipients at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center which is one of the busiest lung transplant centers in the country.



During his training at UPMC, his leadership and clinical skills were once more identified as he was asked to serve as the chief fellow for the Critical Care fellowship program. During his stay at Pittsburgh, his clinical training was complemented by clinical research training. He has been involved in multiple on going clinical trials and he authored a chapter on the management of lung transplant recipients in the critical care setting. He was recruited by the University of Florida's Department of Medicine to join the lung transplant service to offer his expertise in the clinical care of patients in need of lung transplantation, as well as the management of lung transplant recipients to include post surgical critical care and long term care.

Infection is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the first year after transplantation. On the Infectious Diseases Solid Organ Transplant (SOT) Service there is a dynamic interaction between the transplant surgical teams, the medical subspecialty transplant services, and the infectious diseases consultants caring for patients with kidney, liver, heart, and lung transplants. At UF Shands several hundred solid organ transplants are performed each year and a broad range of fascinating infections and clinical problems are encountered on the ID SOT service. These patients are followed both inpatient and outpatient by ID SOT.

<research>

Up to 3 million Americans are stricken with type 1 diabetes, but the epidemic spans the globe and is rapidly worsening. The frequency of the disease has already soared five-fold in the past 50 years alone, and the costs to human health come into sharp focus. Diabetes is one of six leading causes of death in the United States, and the No. 1 cause of acquired blindness, kidney failure and non-traumatic amputation. It also fuels cardiovascular disease, the nation's No. 1 killer, and accounts for more than $174 billion in health-care expenditures, with type 1 diabetes accounting for a disproportionate share of those costs. Dr Schatz' research has focused on the prediction, natural history, genetics, immunopathogenesis and prevention of Type 1 diabetes, as well as the management of children and adolescents with Type 1 diabetes.

Dr. Segal's research focuses on the mechanisms of the increased cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and women who have preeclampsia or preterm delivery. His hypothesis is that a key determinate of whether an individual will develop chronic kidney disease or atherosclerosis is the ability of the individual's endothelium to tolerate their level of blood pressure, glycemia, or other stressors to the endothelium.

<biography>

Dr. Shriner is double boarded in both internal medicine and psychiatry. He is a graduate of Brown University. Prior to joining the University of Florida (UF) as the Psychiatrist in Chief of Vista Hospital, he dedicated his practice to the management of medical disorders that affect the psychiatric well being of patients. He specializes in the treatment of obesity, diabetes and weight management issues. As one of a limited number of dual boarded internal medicine/psychiatry physicians in the country, Dr. Shriner has privileges in both psychiatry and internal medicine at UF.


Before coming to Gainesville, Dr. Shriner worked extensively in the Sarasota and the Tampa Bay Area coordinating the care and management of complex medical patients. During this time, he created many innovative medical/psychiatric patient care programs along with physician care networks involving surgery, medicine, psychiatry, psychology and nursing. He has also developed many computer based patient education and communication tools. These tools give patients a greater understanding of their illness while teaching them how to take positive control over the outcome of their own health care and well being.


In addition to over 25 years of clinical experience as a medical psychiatrist, Dr. Shriner has been an executive medical director, chairman of a department of psychiatry and has extensive experience in the education of nurses, medical students, residents and fellows.


Dr. Shriner is the author of research articles, chapters in textbooks, computer programs and patient wellness tools involving obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, women's issue medicine, food addiction, depression, anxiety and other medical/psychiatric disease states.


Married for over 35 years, he has two sons, has been a high school hockey coach and has a special weakness for Golden Retrievers.

Hedna obtained his medical degree at Karnatak University, India, and completed special training in internal medicine at Stanley Medical College in Chennai, India. Hedna received Distinction (first class) in his first and second year of medical school and a 'Certificate of Merit' in 2003 by the department of internal medicine. He then moved to the United Kingdom and completed residencies with a focus in elderly care in cardiology at Scunthorpe General Hospital; stroke at Doncaster Royal Infirmary and pulmonary and cardiology at West Walkes General Hospital.


Hedna came to the United States in 2007 as an intern in internal medicine at North General Hospital in New York. While at North General, he was introduced to medical problems with patients who have social and economic issues, which furthered his interest in providing care for the elderly.


Hedna was accepted into the University of Florida neurology department's residency program in 2008, which was followed by a neurovascular fellowship. Hedna joined the faculty as an assistant professor in 2012. He is board-certified in both neurology and vascular neurology.


His research interests include brain edema after stroke, young stroke including Takayasu's Arteritis, and the role of neuro-inflammation in stroke and mechanisms of arm paresis in MCA stroke. He currently has publications pending on all three subjects and was awarded the Best Research Award for outgoing residents at UF in 2011.

<research>

Our laboratory is interested in murine models of autoimmune disease, both spontaneous and induced. We have two major projects. The first uses mercury chloride to induce an anti-nucleolar response in certain strains of mice. This response is directed to fibrillarin, a ribosomal RNA processing protein and is a specificity most commonly found in systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). We are examining the cellular interactions leading to this response.


In the second major project, we are collaborating with Dr. Edward Wakeland and Dr. Laurence Morel in the complex genetic inheritance of lupus in the NZM/2410 mice, which were derived from the classic (NZBxNZW)F1 model. Genetic intervals have been identified and individually backcrossed onto non-autoimmune strains of mice. Through bone marrow transplant experiments, we are exploring how these genes are expressed and delineating the immunological pathways they affect. The overall goal is to identify genes leading to a break in tolerance to self-antigen.

<biography>

Dr. Laurence M. Solberg earned his medical degree from the Jagiellonian University in Krakow Poland. He completed his residency training in internal medicine and fellowship training in geriatric medicine at Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. Dr. Solberg then joined a private practice of geriatrics at the Lahey Clinic in Burlington Massachusetts. He was the medical director of an Acute Rehabilitation facility and a Long Term Care facility and also the director of geriatric medical education. He also did research on caregiver stress in dementia patients.


Dr. Solberg moved to Vanderbilt University School of Medicine to pursue an academic career with medical student and resident education focusing on the use of automated "just-in-time" learning integrated with geriatrics consultations in the hospital. While at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine he was awarded a geriatrics academic career award (GACA) from HRSA. Dr. Solberg's research focused on nursing recognition of delirium in the hospitalized older patient and the communication between nurses and doctors using electronic order sets and computerized decision support tools. He published several articles on these topics.


Dr. Solberg is active in the American Geriatrics Society serving on the program planning committee and the Junior Faculty Development Task Force. He is a frequent speaker at national symposia and has presented many abstracts at national scientific meetings. In 2012 Dr. Solberg was inducted as a fellow in the American Geriatrics Society for contributions to the field in clinical, educational, and research activities.


In 2013 Dr. Solberg was recruited to join the faculty at the University of Florida as the Chief of the Division of Geriatric Medicine and the Chief of the Division of Career Development and Education. He is the Ruth Jewett Professor of Geriatric Medicine at the University of Florida. Under Dr. Solberg's leadership the division of geriatric medicine is growing in patient care opportunities and faculty. Dr. Solberg is also affiliated with the Malcom Randall VA Medical Center, NF/SGVHS with an appointment in the Geriatric Research Education Clinical Center (GRECC) focusing on the effort to avoid readmissions to the hospital in the older veteran population.

<biography>

Louis Solomon, M.D. is a clinical assistant professor in the University of Florida College of Medicine Department of Psychiatry.


Ideally suited for chief of brain stimulation, Dr. Solomon is both a psychiatrist and neurosurgeon and has an extensive background in neuroanatomy and neuroscience. Dr. Solomon believes electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and deep brain stimulation (DBS) are treatments that have changed the face of psychiatry. TMS is an outpatient treatment proven effective in treating depressive illness. Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who have not completely responded to one or more antidepressants are ideal patients for TMS.


ECT has been much improved and continues to be used safely and effectively at UF. DBS has been used experimentally at UF for Parkinson's Disease and other movement disorders, OCD and trials are expected in depression. Dr. Solomon is an exemplary psychiatrist who is very active in the community volunteering as a physician and psychiatrist at the Helping Hands free clinic and elsewhere. He helps 'student doctors' understand that psychiatry is a science but also an art built through experience. Trainees participate in the management of patients and can see that psychiatric treatments can be very effective.


Dr. Solomon has considerable experience in neurology-neurosurgery-psychiatry and draws from these areas to help individual patients.

<biography>

Lisa R.P. Spiguel, M.D., has joined the University of Florida department of surgery as an assistant professor in the division of general surgery's surgical oncology service.


Spiguel's clinical focus is on the surgical care of breast cancer and benign breast disease, the assessment of high risk breast cancer patients and overall breast health. She offers the full spectrum of surgical breast care, including breast-conservation surgery, nipple- and skin-sparing mastectomies, modified radical mastectomies and axillary surgery. She uses an oncoplastic technique to rearrange breast tissue for a natural form after breast conservation surgery.


Prior to joining UF, she completed the Lynn Sage Breast Surgery Fellowship at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. Prior to her fellowship, Spiguel trained in general surgery at the University of Chicago Medical Center and earned her medical degree at Wayne State University in Detroit.

Spiguel's clinical focus is on the surgical care of breast cancer and benign breast disease, the assessment of high-risk breast cancer patients and overall breast health. She offers the full spectrum of surgical breast care, including breast-conservation surgery, nipple- and skin-sparing mastectomies, modified radical mastectomies and axillary surgery. She uses an oncoplastic technique to rearrange breast tissue for a natural form after breast conservation surgery.


Her research interests focus on clinical outcomes for breast cancer treatment to promote advances in surgical care. Her previous research has focused on nipple-sparing mastectomy procedures and defining oncologic safety and surgical techniques to optimize results, as well as the role of axillary node dissection in patients with limited axillary disease undergoing breast conservation surgery.

<research>

Dr. Stacpoole's federally-sponsored research is broadly focused in two areas: intermediary metabolism and new drug development. He conducts patient oriented research on the Shands Hospital Clinical Research Center (CRC) and collaborates with investigators across N. America into the causes and treatment of genetic mitochondrial diseases, due to nuclear DNA or mitochondrial DNA mutations in genes that encode enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism or oxidative phosphorylation. These studies also engage collaborators with expertise in neurology, neurobehavior, clinical pharmacology, neuroscience and cell and molecular biology.


Related research includes mechanistically oriented laboratory studies on the molecular and biochemical consequences of loss-of-function mutations in the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) and therapeutic interventions for PDC deficiency. He also collaborates with other faculty at the University of Florida to investigate the regulation of homocystine metabolism in humans in response to different genotypes or nutritional perturbations.


With regard to new drug development, Dr. Stacpoole and his colleagues have developed a prototype for a novel class of investigational drugs for the treatment of acquired or inborn errors of mitochondrial energy metabolism and lactic acidosis. The prototype of this class, dichloroacetate (DCA), is undergoing clinical trials on the CRC in healthy subjects and in children and adults with congenital lactic acidosis. Its sites and mechanisms of action are being further explored by in vitro and in vivo laboratory studies employing cell and molecular techniques and mass spectrometry.

<biography>

Dr. Sanda Tan, a board-certified colorectal surgeon, joined the UF College of Medicine in 2007.


She earned her medical degree from Emory University School of Medicine, where she also completed her general surgery residency training. She then completed a colon and rectal surgical fellowship at Brown University. Prior to her medical training she earned a doctorate in medical sciences at Brown University.


Dr. Tan is part of the UF colorectal surgery team, which specializes in laparoscopic and open procedures for benign and malignant tumors of the colon, rectum and anus. In addition to offering transanal endoscopic microsurgery, or TEM, for rectal tumors, UF colorectal surgeons offer the complete array of open and minimally invasive procedures, including lower anterior resections, total mesorectal excisions for rectal cancer, and other advanced sphincter-sparing techniques to help patients retain their anus and preservation of function.


The colorectal surgical team also works to develop and apply new strategies for helping patients in maintaining continence, including sphincteroplasty and minimally invasive stapled transanal rectal resections (the STARR procedure) for those with obstructed defecation syndrome. For hemorrhoids, UF surgeons offer transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization, or THD.


Dr. Tan is director of the UF Pelvic Floor Program, a multidisciplinary team of UF physicians, including gynecologists, urologists, gastroenterologists and colorectal surgeons, who collaborate to provide complete care for patients with pelvic floor disorders.

Rajiv Tandon, MD, is the Chief of Psychiatry in the Program of Mental Health at the State of Florida Department of Children and Families. Formerly, he was promoted to Associate Professor, given Tenure and rose to Professor at the Department of Psychiatry in the University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor, from 1987-2004. In addition to his medical degree, he has a Master's degree in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis from the University of Michigan School of Public Health and a diploma in Business Administration from the Harvard University Business School. At the University of Michigan, he developed the clinical and research Schizophrenia Program, which was the sixth most published schizophrenia program in the world in the 1990's.


Additionally, he held a variety of administrative responsibilities, including directing the Hospital Services Division (inpatient, consultation-liaison, and emergency psychiatry) and Division of Community Psychiatry from 1996-2000. From 1993-1996, he was the Director of the Adult Inpatient Psychiatry Program and the electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) Program. At the University of Michigan Medical Center, his clinical responsibilities were primarily on the adult inpatient unit, which he directed from 1993-1996. His research focus has been the psychopathology and neurobiology of schizophrenia. Since 2000, he has been a member of the Scientific Council of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill and on the Board of Directors of the National Schizophrenia Foundation (Chair 2002-2005).


Dr. Tandon has authored more than 250 scientific publications, and given over 600 national and international scientific presentations. He has received several awards for research and teaching in schizophrenia, including the American Psychiatric Association Young Psychiatrist Researcher of the Year award in 1993 and the a1997 Future Psych award for outstanding achievement in schizophrenia research. He has been included in every edition of THE BEST DOCTORS IN AMERICA since 1995. His principal areas of research interest include psychopharmacology of schizophrenia and neurobiology of schizophrenia. He is a member of the NASMHPD Medical Directors' Board, a member of the World Psychiatric Association Section on Pharmacopsychiatry, and a member of the DSM-V workgroup on psychotic disorders. He is also a member of the editorial boards of several journals. He has been a member of several NIH study sections over his career.


In his capacity Chief of Psychiatry in the Office of Mental Health in the Department of Children and Families, he has participated in the development of a number of innovative programs. He was a member of the Blueprint Commission on Juvenile Justice as also a member of the Supreme Court Subcommittee on Criminal Justice and Mental Health (Leifman committee). He has been intimately involved in the development of a range of evidence-based psychopharmacology programs both in the hospital-based and community settings. He has over 25 years of experience in the evaluation and treatment of psychiatric patients, as national expert, researcher, and mentor.


<em>
According to Dr Tandon " I am excited to relocate and work full time at the University of of Florida College of Medicine. I look forward to working with colleagues at Shands at Vista , the Shands NPEU. the VA and just the opportunity of participating in future development of the many excellent centers and research programs at the University of Florida College of Medicine. I think we can create an even more conducive atmosphere for successful academic growth. Enhanced federal research funding, development of a clinical and research center of excellence in psychotic disorders, more peer-reviewed publications in Schizophrenia and major psychiatric disorders, mentorship of junior faculty and residents reflected in their career development and K-awards, development of a Center for Translational Research and Clinical Effectiveness, and greater international presence/prominence would be useful indices of more excellence"

<biography>

Dr. Jose Trevino is an assistant professor of surgery at the University of Florida College of Medicine. His clinical focus is on liver, bile duct and pancreas surgery.


Dr. Trevino earned his medical degree and completed his residency at the University of Illinois at Chicago. He was a research fellow at University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and a clinical fellow in surgical oncology at H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute in Tampa.


His research interests include pancreatic cancer biology, tumor signaling and chemoresistance. Dr. Trevino currently is investigating how pancreas cancer resists current chemotherapeutic strategies. He has discovered that exposure to nicotine, the addictive component of tobacco smoke, may contribute to pancreatic cancer resistance to chemotherapy by potentially increasing expression levels of certain oncoprotients, such as Src, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase and inhibitor of differentiation-1(Id-1), all of which have been demonstrated to contribute to pancreatic cancer tumor progression. This work, as well as other projects he is involved in, may lead to new treatment strategies against pancreatic cancer.


Dr. Trevino has earned various honors, including induction into the Alpha Omega Alpha Medical Honor Society and the American Association for Cancer Research Minority Scholar Award.

<biography>

Daniel M. Tucker, MD is an associate professor at the University of Florida College of Medicine Department of Psychiatry and chief of the division of child and adolescent psychiatry. Dr. Tucker graduated from Yale University before attending medical school at the University of Florida. He completed his residency and a fellowship in child psychiatry at the University of Louisville, and was an NIMH postdoctoral research fellow in child psychiatry at Yale University's Yale Child Study Center.


He developed his research interests and received a Stanley Grant to evaluate and study the role of infectious diseases in OCD, autism, and other childhood psychiatric diseases. Dr. Tucker has taught psychiatrists how to be excellent, compassionate and empathic child psychiatrists at the University of Louisville, Yale and now the University of Florida.


As Chief of the Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at his medical alma mater, he asserts a wealth of experience in general child and adolescent psychiatry at all levels of the continuum of care, and brings his dedicated mission of keeping the best of old psychiatry(talking and listening) to the best of new psychiatry (modern diagnostics, psychopharmacology, inter-disciplinary collaboration, historic-socio-anthropologic perspectives, and a pragmatic, non-dogmatic approach) to the treating of children, adolescents, and their families.


His current research interests include post infectious, immunologic aspects of psychiatry, neuroimaging, obsessive compulsive disorder, Tourette's disorder, ADHD, and the Autism spectrum of disorders. In his commitment to teaching the next generation of psychiatrists and nurturing in them the truest flame of his accumulated expertise, he brings dedication to leaving no effort unspent helping his patients.

<em>Research and Scholarly Interests:</em>



Dr. Ward has been a pioneer in the development of brain stimulation treatments for psychiatric diseases. His research in this area with Drs Foote, Okun, and Goodman have been widely referenced and led to the University of Florida being one of the pivotal sites in the evaluation of DBS in OCD. He is also a key investigator in a RO-1 to evaluate DBS in major depression. His overall interests come out of a background in pharmacology and specialty training in medicine, depression, and anxiety disorders. He is interested in the neurobiology of anxiety and the development of new treatment strategies, including combination therapies for optimal synaptic benefit and reduction of adverse effects. Additionally, he is interested in improving recognition of anxiety disorders in primary care and testing a parallel model for delivery of medical and psychiatric services. His recent peer reviewed, high impact publications are listed on this page.



<em>Educational Interests and Accomplishments:</em>



Dr. Ward is very interested in the application of formal clinical decision making to the field of psychiatry. He teaches Psychiatrists-in-training, medical students, internal medicine and other Residents, and Fellows in his clinic. It is both highly rated and a very effective clinical setting to train new academic Faculty. Since the psychiatric interview is the "gold standard" for detecting disease, psychiatry has lagged behind other specialties in using Bayesian analysis to enrich our clinical impression and guide treatment. He also enjoys teaching residents how to integrate pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, i.e., how to establish a psycho-social gradient that favors a desired drug response. He has contributed to the medical school curriculum development by serving on the Interdisciplinary Generalist Clerkship Curriculum Committee and the Task Force on Vertical Integration of Neurobehavioral Sciences. Dr. Ward has received the departmental Teacher of the Year award and served on Departmental Graduate Education Committee and Resident Recruitment Committee.

<research>

Dr. Weiner's primary research interests involve examining the mechanisms and regulation of renal ammonia metabolism and transport. Ammonia plays a central role in acid-base homeostasis, as it is the primary component of basal net acid excretion and changes in ammonia excretion comprise almost 90% of the renal response to acid-base alterations. Renal ammonia transport has traditionally been believed to involve "ammonium (NH4+) trapping" and diffusive NH3 movement. Dr. Weiner's laboratory examines the specific mechanisms of renal NH3 movement, and has shown that, in contrast to previously thought models, that NH3 transport involves specific proteins, namely, Rh glycoproteins. These proteins are widely expressed in ammonia transporting tissues, and Dr. Weiner's studies, using a variety of
<em>in vivo</em>
and
<em>in vitro</em>
models, including transgenic animal models utilizing cell-specific gene deletion, have shown the central role of these proteins in renal ammonia, and thereby acid-base, homeostasis. Dr. Weiner has presented this work in a wide variety of international symposium, including invited symposium talks at American Society of Nephrology, Korean Society of Nephrology, International Congress of Nephrology and Experimental Biology 2011.

<biography>

Dr. Stanton Wesson graduated magna cum laude from the University of West Florida in 1976. One month after his graduation he joined the U.S. Navy with the rank of Ensign. In May 1980, he was awarded a Doctor of Medicine degree from the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences School of Medicine. He was both a pediatric intern and a dermatology resident at the Naval Medical Center in Bethesda.


He had a long and distinguished career in the Navy. At the U.S. Naval Hospital in Jacksonville, he served as Department Head, (1990-1995), Medical Staff President (1995-1997), Director of Clinical Services (1997-1998), and Executive Officer (1998-1999). He retired from the Navy in 2000.


Dr. Wesson has many awards for his service and courage. His Army awards include the Bronze Star, Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal with 25 Oak Leaf Cluster (26 total awards of air medal). At the time of his retirement from the Navy he was awarded the Legion of Merit (this equates to a Silver Star for service).


Teaching and education
- Dr. Wesson is an outstanding educator. Since 2003 he has been the Director of the Dermatology Residency Training Program as well as the Director of Medical Student Education. Since 2004, he has had sole responsibility for all the dermatology lectures to the second year medical students. He has served as mentor and director of medical student, physician assistant students, and pharmacy students since 2002. He has given Medical Grand Rounds at the University of Florida five times as well as many Dermatology Grand Rounds. Dr. Wesson has lectured at the "Internal Medicine Update" course for the past five years. He has always been available to lecture on dermatology, medical leadership and management of military hospital activities.


His commitment to education was recognized in 2007, 2008, and 2010 by receiving the University of Florida Exemplary Teacher Award.


Finally, he has been an active and involved member of the Medical School Admissions Committee for the past two years. He has approached this with the same zeal and enthusiasm he has for all his many clinical, administrative, and educational functions.


Administrative Service
- At the U.S. Naval Hospital, Jacksonville, Florida, he served as Department Head, Medical Staff President and Director of Clinical Services. From 1998-1999 he served as the Chief Operating Officer for the Naval Hospital, Jacksonville, Florida, as well as eight Branch Ambulatory Medical Clinics in Florida and Georgia.


He has been Director, Dermatology Residency Program since 2003. Following our last site visit by the ACGME, the Dermatology Residency Training Program was approved for the full five years.


Clinical Service
- Dr. Wesson spends approximately 80% of his time in the clinics. He directs the Dermatology Resident Continuity Clinics, the Resident Pediatric Dermatology Clinic, and a Dermatology Resident Surgery Clinic. The clinics are necessary to meet ACGME requirements for our residency training program. He staffs the inpatient consultation service one to two times per week. He takes call from home approximately one week per month.

Research:
80 percent of Dr. Wesson's time is spent in clinic. This leaves precious little time for research. He has 11 publications related to clinical dermatology. He is frequently called up for input in clinical trials for which he receives no recognition (at his request). He inspires all those around him with ideas and concepts regarding disease pathogenesis and treatment. He is an avid member of the Society of Investigative Dermatology and always shares what he learns at their meeting with faculty and housestaff.

The long-range objective of Dr. Whitehead's research program is to improve health outcomes and well-being among low income and minority populations, who face the greatest inequities in health care, through effective interventions that bridge the gaps in traditional care. Her work focuses on those coping with HIV/AIDS and Breast Cancer. Dr. Whitehead's current research program has two aims. First, using community based participatory methods, her work aims to understand the unique factors that influence inequities in health outcomes among low income and minority populations. Second, to apply this knowledge in the development and dissemination of effective interventions that bridge the gaps in care.

<biography>

Dr. Charles Williams is professor of pediatrics and faculty member of the Division of Genetics and Metabolism. He is board-certified in medical genetics and pediatrics and received his M.D. degree from the University of Florida. From 1986 until 2000 he served as chief of the Division of Genetics and has since conducted clinical research on neurogenetic disorders. The majority of his academic assignment involves evaluating families in the Division's clinics that are held in Gainesville and throughout central and north Florida. He also provides consultation to the Florida School for the Deaf and Blind in St. Augustine.



Dr. Williams has published widely in scholarly journals and has also developed web-based sites and teaching modules. He has a long-term research and advocay interest in Angelman syndrome, and was instrumental in founding the US Angelman Syndrome Foundation (ASF) where he currently serves as member of the board and chair of the ASF Scientific Advisory Committee.


He has a special research interest in neurogenetic and neuromuscular syndromes including those involving brain malformations, neural migration disorders and/or mitochondrial dysfunction. He is often consulted to evaluate children who have had extensive genetic and metabolic testing but in whom no cause has yet been found for their developmental problem. Dr. Williams' practice involves the application of new diagnostic genetic tests including next-generation assays such as whole exome sequencing.

<research>

Much of my research has been dedicated to the study of Angelman syndrome, a rare genetic disorder demonstrating imprinting, and caused by disruption of
<em>UBE3A</em>
. The locus for Angelman is on chromosome 15q11.2-13 and I have sought to determine clinical phenotype to genotype relationships for various classes of individuals with the syndrome: microdeletions involving the large genomic region, disruption of the imprinting center, paternal uniparental disomy or intra-genomic mutations within the
<em>UBE3A</em>
. By establishing an Angelman syndrome repository over several decades, in collaboration with Dr. Daniel Driscoll, we have been able to initially delineate some of the primary phenotype to genotype relationships that are now well established for the syndrome. As a clinical researcher, I have continued my interest in Angelman syndrome by evaluating other genetic conditions that can mimic the clinical features of this disorder. I have most recently studied disruptions of
<em>MBD5</em>
, a methyl binding protein which can either be disrupted by whole gene deletions or intra-gene mutations. Other syndromes known to mimic Angelman have also been the subject of my investigations including Mowat-Wilson, Rett and Pitt-Hopkins syndromes, and several rare microdeletion and microduplication disorders. Evolving from my interest in Angelman syndrome, I also research on other neurogenetic syndromes and this work involves collaboration with several genetic centers capable of performing advanced genetic analysis such as whole exomic and whole genomic sequencing.

Dr. Wingo's nephrology interest includes disorders of fluid and electrolyte balance, acid-base balance and hypertension. Our studies on the mechanism of action of aldosterone have led to a more complete understanding of the importance of this hormone in various clinical disease states. Additional interests include the role of blood pressure control and of protein and phosphorous restriction on the progression of renal disease to end-stage.


During the past 15 years, the primary focus of his laboratory has been the study of solute transport within the distal nephron and collecting duct. The majority of this research has utilized the in vitro microperfusion technique, membrane vesicles and immunoblotting, and metabolic balance techniques. Additional studies have examined the proteins responsible for this transport. Several of his key observations are outlined below.


Both metabolic and respiratory acidosis inhibit chloride transport in the thick ascending limb of Henle. These studies provide a partial explanation for the natriuresis, chloruresis and diuresis associated with systemic acidosis.


In the cortical collecting duct potassium secretion occurs in part by a mechanism of secondary active potassium chloride secretion. The importance of these observations can be related to certain pathologic states in which there is inappropriate potassium wasting by the kidney, for example, as in chloride depletion metabolic alkalosis.


The cortical and outer medullary collecting duct possess a mechanism of active potassium absorption coupled to proton secretion. This occurs in part by the H+-K+-ATPase that is transcriptionally competent in the stomach and in the kidney. These observations represent a newly discovered mechanism of potassium absorption and proton secretion by the collecting duct, and they may explain certain forms of hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis.


The physiological studies include the characterization of the signal transduction pathway involved in stimulation of H+-K+-ATPase in response to changes in ambient pCO2


Currently, his laboratory investigations include the molecular characterization of the renal H+-K+-ATPase gene products in the kidney, colon and stomach and their transcriptional regulation, studies that are being performed in collaboration with Dr. Brian D. Cain in the Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry. Additonal studies are examining the effect of hypokalemia and aldosterone on mRNA expression in the renal medulla and vascular smooth muscle.


Other studies are examining the ion channels present at the apical membrane of the outer medullary collecting duct with Dr. Shin-Ling Xia.

He did his internship training in University of Virginia and neurological residency in University of Texas Medical Branch(PGY 2, PGY3) and University of Florida( PGY 4). He then completed a year of fellowship training in Neuromuscular Medicine/University of Florida. He also completed the training as a trainee of Clinical Research Consortium for Spinocerebellar Ataxias/National Instituees of Health.


Dr. Xia is board-certified in American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology(ABPN), Neuromuscular Medicine Board and American Board of Electrodiagnostic Medicine(ABEM). He is a member of American Academy of Neurology and International Society for Stem Cell Research(ISSCR). Dr. Xia is clinically specialized in Neuromuscular Medicine. He holds hospital privileges for electromyograph and nerve conduction study(EMG/NCS), muscle biopsy and skin biopsy. His clinical practice includes management of patients with motor neuron diseases, neuropathies, myasthenia gravis, myopathy, muscular dystrophies and other neuromuscular disorders. He pratices in Shands Medical Plaza and in MDA and ataxia clinic in Uf Center for Movement Disorders and Neurorestoration with Dr. Ashizawa and Dr. Subramony.


Dr. Xia's research interest is disease-specific induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell in the application of neurodegenerative disorders. Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) and Myotonic Dystrophy type 1 and type 2 are his current research focus. They have successfully established disease-specific iPS cell lines for SCA 2, SCA 3 and cell lines for DM1. These disease-specific iPS cells will create a translational platform for drug development and for the study of cell-replacement therapy. Currently, Dr. Xia is working on a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial of "Therapeutic effect of Dalfampridine on gait incoordination in spinocerebellar ataxias".

<em>Induced pluripotent stem cells</em>
: Dr. Xia's research interest is disease-specific induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell in the application of neurodegenerative disorders. Among them, spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) and Myotonic Dystrophy type 1 and type 2 are his current research focus. Dr. Xia is working closely with Dr. Ashizawa and Dr. Terada. They have successfully established normal iPS cell lines and disease-specific cell lines for SCA 2, SCA 3 and cell lines for DM1 with long and short pathologic repeats. They are characterizing the cell lines as disease cellular models. These disease-specific iPS cells will create a platform for the investigation of disease mechanism and drug development. Correction of mutated gene in iPS cells is challenging but is the critical step for future cell replacement therapy.


<em>Neuropathology:</em>
Dr. Xia's is working on Neuropathology of SCA 10, SCA 3 and Myotonic Dystrophy in collaboration with Dr.Yachnis.


<em>Clinical trials:</em>
Dr. Xia' clinical research interest is therapy of gait incoordination in spinocerebellar ataxias. Currently. He is working on a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial of "Therapeutic effect of Dalfampridine on gait incoordination in spinocerebellar ataxias".

<biography>

Anna Khanna, MD, is an assistant professor of neurology at the UF College of Medicine and is a key member of the only comprehensive stroke program in north central Florida.


Dr. Khanna earned her B.A. in biological sciences from Rutgers University and her M.D. at Ross University School of Medicine. She completed her preliminary internal medicine residency year at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in 1999 and remained there to complete her neurology residency in 2002. Dr. Khanna became a stroke fellow at the university and through its active vascular program used both medical and endovascular therapies for the treatment of stroke; she completed her fellowship in 2003. She remained on faculty as an assistant professor, stroke program director and a mentor to medical students and residents. Dr. Khanna played an integral role in the community outreach for stroke education and traveled extensively to educate the public. As director of the outpatient stroke clinic and director of the resident clinic, Dr. Khanna introduced a comprehensive vascular ultrasound examination in the outpatient setting.


Dr. Khanna then joined the faculty at Saint Barnabas University Hospital in Livingston, NJ, where she was the stroke program director and mentored residents in internal medicine by introducing them to the multitude of vascular disorders. In both hospitals, she trained staff, provided continuing medical education and coordinated with the accreditors in their JACHO Primary Stroke Center accreditation.



Dr. Khanna moved to Florida in 2007 and joined a private practice, providing general neurology care to the Marion County community. Dr. Khanna joined the faculty at the University of Florida as an assistant professor in the neurovascular division in 2011. She is currently providing care to patients on the stroke service and in the outpatient clinic. She mentors two stroke fellows, medical students and residents. Dr. Khanna's main interests are in acute stroke management and continuing research in several clinical trials treating acute stroke.

<biography>

During my 15 years at the University of Florida, one of my focuses has been the multidisciplinary management of patients with pediatric sarcomas of soft tissue and bone. Currently, I serve as the Medical Director for the UF Radiation Oncology Department and participate in several national professional societies and committees, including the American Board of Radiology and the Radiologic Society of North America. Clinical research productivity includes 55 peer-reviewed publications and several supporting grants. My clinical practice integrates translational research collaborations with our UF Prostate Disease Center, and also with our medical physics and informatics programs. Direct collaboration with colleagues in the UF Cancer and Genetics Institute connects my PhD training in Pharmacology with the applied radiation biology, to facilitate the translation of laboratory research to clinical application in the delivery of multi-modality integrated cancer therapies. My specific technical interests include the management of metastatic cancers utilizing the technologies of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) with Image Guidance (IGRT), which employ accelerated hypo-fractionation dose delivery protocols; and 2) the development of emerging mobile and interactive technologies to enable an eMedical infrastructure to facilitate the collection of physician and patient reported quality and satisfaction data related to cancer diagnosis, treatment, and Quality of Life (QoL) outcomes.
